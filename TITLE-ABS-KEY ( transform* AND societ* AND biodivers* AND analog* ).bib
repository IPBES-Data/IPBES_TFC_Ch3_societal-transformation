	abstract = {Fossil discoveries over the past 30 years have radically transformed traditional views of Mesozoic mammal evolution. In addition, recent research provides a more detailed account of the Cretaceous diversification of flowering plants. Here, we examine patterns of morphological disparity and functional morphology associated with diet in early mammals. Two analyses were performed: (i) an examination of diversity based on functional dental type rather than higher-level taxonomy, and (ii) a morphometric analysis of jaws, which made use of modern analogues, to assess changes in mammalian morphological and dietary disparity. Results demonstrate a decline in diversity of molar types during the mid-Cretaceous as abundances of triconodonts, symmetrodonts, docodonts and eupantotherians diminished. Multituberculates experience a turnover in functional molar types during the mid-Cretaceous and a shift towards plant-dominated diets during the late Late Cretaceous. Although therians undergo a taxonomic expansion coinciding with the angiosperm radiation, they display small body sizes and a low level of morphological disparity, suggesting an evolutionary shift favouring small insectivores. It is concluded that during the mid-Cretaceous, the period of rapid angiosperm radiation, mammals experienced both a decrease in morphological disparity and a functional shift in dietary morphology that were probably related to changing ecosystems. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Cross-feeding interactions are a common feature of many microbial systems, such as colonies of Escherichia coli grown on a single limiting resource, and microbial consortia cooperatively degrading complex compounds. We have studied this phenomenon from an abstract point of view by considering artificial organisms that metabolize binary strings from a shared environment. The organisms are represented as simple cellular automaton rules and the analog of energy in the system is an approximation of the Shannon entropy of the binary strings. Only organisms that increase the entropy of the transformed strings are allowed to replicate. This system exhibits a large degree of species diversity, which increases when the flow of binary strings into the system is reduced. Investigating the relation between ecosystem productivity and diversity we find that diversity is negatively correlated with biomass production and energy uptake, while it correlates positively with energy-uptake efficiency. By performing invasion experiments, we show that the source of diversity is negative frequency-dependent selection acting among the different species, and that some of these interactions are intransitive, another mechanism known to promote diversity. © 2010 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Perennial horticulture is facing many challenges as consumers and societies reconsider what is expected of future food systems in the face of population growth and urbanisation, climate change, biodiversity loss, and supply chain and other shocks. Digital technologies offer many opportunities for increasing the precision and sophistication of production systems and supply chains in response to these challenges. However, many current agritech products and services address only single needs and do not explicitly draw on the richness of our knowledge in plant and ecological sciences. These limitations can be addressed through digital twins, which are increasingly being adopted across diverse fields to monitor, analyse, simulate and control complex systems. In this paper we describe the approach The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (Plant & Food Research) is adopting to develop a digital twin to leverage the transformative opportunities offered through the purposeful integration of biology and digital technologies. Our goal is to dynamically couple physical components of apple production and supply chain systems with their virtual analogues. The digital twin will direct sensors and external interfaces to obtain input data from the real world, and prescribe optimal interventions based on models that robustly simulate the impact of selected biotic and abiotic stresses on key physiological, ecological and quality modifying processes. We are approaching this task through a series of tightly coordinated research programmes organised around the themes of: building the digital ecosystem; new models of the perennial horticulture ecosystem; and developing and deploying digital twins. We expect that this digital twin can offer new opportunities to increase the profitability, resilience and sustainability of perennial crop systems. © 2023 International Society for Horticultural Science.

	abstract = {Wasalexins A and B are crucifer phytoalexins produced by two substantially different plant species, a wild species abundant in the Canadian prairies and a condiment plant widely cultivated in Japan. Interestingly, both plant species are resistant to an economically important fungal plant pathogen, the blackleg fungus [Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not., asexual stage Phoma lingam (Tode ex Fr.) Desm.]. The transformation of wasalexins A and B in cultures of isolates of L. maculans, an isolate highly virulent towards canola (BJ 125) and a less common isolate which is virulent towards wasabi (Laird 2/Mayfair 2) was investigated. It was established that both fungal isolates are able to efficiently metabolize and detoxify wasalexins A and B through reduction in the case of wasalexin A or through hydrolysis followed by reduction in the case of wasalexin B. Moreover, a close structural analogue of wasalexins, which does not occur naturally, was also found to be reduced in cultures of L. maculans. The structures of the new metabolic products were elucidated using spectroscopic methods and were confirmed by synthesis. Bioassays indicated that the biotransformation of wasalexins is a detoxification process that may contribute to the aggressive nature of these fungal isolates towards plants that produce wasalexins. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of proton transport through mammalian UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) expressed in yeast mitochondria were measured. There was little or no UCP1 activity in the absence of added palmitate, but significant activity in its presence. The activator 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) had little effect when added alone, but significantly enhanced proton conductance in the presence of added palmitate. Activation of the proton conductance of UCP1 was synergistic: proton conductance in the presence of both palmitate and 4-HNE was significantly greater than the sum of the individual effects. Mitochondria from control yeast transformed with empty vector showed no such synergy, showing that synergy is a property of UCP1. Activation by the 4-HNE analogue trans-cinnamate showed essentially the same characteristics as activation by 4-HNE. Mitochondria from brown adipose tissue also showed synergistic activation of GDP-sensitive proton conductance by palmitate and 4-HNE. These results show that reactive alkenals activate the proton conductance of UCP1 more strongly when fatty acids are also added, with implications for both mechanistic and physiological models of UCP1 activation. © 2006 Biochemical Society.},

	abstract = {With global environmental sustainability at the crossroads, approaches are needed to build an ecologically literate culture for collective societal navigation through the intricacies of swift environmental change. This paper demonstrates a transdisciplinary approach, grounded at the intersection between the arts and sciences, to increase awareness and understanding of the current biodiversity crisis. It focuses on one aspect of biodiversity, beta diversity, which examines how sets of animal and plant species differ between habitats. Theory and real examples of beta diversity of aquatic animal and plant species from dried-out ponds in Mediterranean Spain are presented in pixelized visuals. These visuals are artistic expression of and build the prior knowledge about beta diversity, which is scrutinized subsequently with statistical analyses to support the artistic approach with an objectively identified and numerically underpinned presentation of structure in the visuals. The choice to examine beta diversity in theory and reality first through art and then through science is deliberate. Combined, these aspects examine biodiversity through an eco-centric, rather than a species- and habitat centric view, incorporate elements of surprise (how can aquatic species in dry ecosystems survive), and reduce uncertainty (by providing a common numerical yardstick for interpreting the visuals). Together they can optimize a goal-directed learning process in the viewers necessary for making judgments, inducing affective reactions, and facilitating memory and decision making. The approach presented here provides an integral qualitative and quantitative model useful for a broader inductive-deductive education process towards finding sustainable solutions as our planet moves swiftly to a future without historical analogue. Combined art-sciences approaches, as the one presented here, are useful to facilitate citizens’ comprehension of the scientific and potential policy dimensions of environmental change, including biodiversity problems, especially because it is the general public that bears the costs of transformation and adaptation measures. © 2016, The Author(s).},
