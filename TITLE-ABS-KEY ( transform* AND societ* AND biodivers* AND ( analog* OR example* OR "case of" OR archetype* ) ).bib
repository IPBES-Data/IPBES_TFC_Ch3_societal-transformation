	abstract = {To halt further destruction of the biosphere, most people and societies around the globe need to transform their relationships with nature. The internationally agreed vision under the Convention of Biological Diversity—Living in harmony with nature—is that “By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people”. In this context, there are a variety of debates between alternative perspectives on how to achieve this vision. Yet, scenarios and models that are able to explore these debates in the context of “living in harmony with nature” have not been widely developed. To address this gap, the Nature Futures Framework has been developed to catalyse the development of new scenarios and models that embrace a plurality of perspectives on desirable futures for nature and people. In this paper, members of the IPBES task force on scenarios and models provide an example of how the Nature Futures Framework can be implemented for the development of illustrative narratives representing a diversity of desirable nature futures: information that can be used to assess and develop scenarios and models whilst acknowledging the underpinning value perspectives on nature. Here, the term illustrative reflects the multiple ways in which desired nature futures can be captured by these narratives. In addition, to explore the interdependence between narratives, and therefore their potential to be translated into scenarios and models, the six narratives developed here were assessed around three areas of the transformative change debate, specifically, (1) land sparing vs. land sharing, (2) Half Earth vs. Whole Earth conservation, and (3) green growth vs. post-growth economic development. The paper concludes with an assessment of how the Nature Futures Framework could be used to assist in developing and articulating transformative pathways towards desirable nature futures. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Globally, farming systems are mostly dominated by monoculture, which has the advantage of profitability at the expense of ecological systems. Recent years have witnessed an increasing mo-mentum in global efforts to deploy sustainable agriculture practices that mimic ecological processes, with agroecology at the forefront. In addition to the ecological aspect, agroecology also encompasses economic and social aspects targeting the whole food system. Transformative agroecology has been recognized as a stepping stone to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), due to its great potential to build climate change-resilient farming systems while enhancing ecosystem services and reducing biodiversity loss. Nonetheless, the available literature on the recent developments and future trajectories of the adoption of agroecology approaches for improving the production of cereals, the most important group of food crops, is limited. This review aims to highlight the blueprint of agroecology that can contribute to the achievements of the SDGs, allowing explicit interpretation of the term that will benefit twenty-first century agriculture. Using cereal crops as the case study, we provide insights into how far this field has come and the main barriers to its adoption, and conclude that this approach of “science for and with society” is the way forward for building a resilient future. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The environment is in crisis. Climate science and biodiversity loss indicators, for example, illustrate the extent of environmental degradation and the concerns with the sustainability of Earth, or perhaps more specifically, the ability of Earth to sustain (human) life. There is also an increasing recognition of the environmental crisis as urgent, as an emergency, yet whether we are acting sufficiently to the environmental crisis is still up for debate. These debates have become more evident in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a context within which to consider what it means to respond to a crisis and how the environment might feature in any post-COVID recovery. In this essay, we first outline and reflect on crisis, urgency and (in)action through a consideration of the environmental crisis and the COVID-19 crisis before moving to our main focus – the implications for environmental accounting. Specifically, we suggest that the construction of environmental accounting as accounting for the long-term, an attempt to contrast it with and overcome the problems with short-term conventional accounting, potentially contributes to the construction of the environment as lacking urgency and potentially enables its marginalisation. We argue that in order to make the most of accounting's potential as a constitutive force, capable of participating in transforming preferences, decisions and behaviour in organisations and societies, environmental accounting needs to be about the short-term. We contribute to the ongoing discussions on how accounting needs to change if it is to recognise the urgent nature of the environmental crisis. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Coastal deltas are landforms that typically offer a wide variety of benefits to society including highly fertile soils for agricultural development, freshwater resources, and rich biodiversity. For these reasons, many deltas are densely populated, are important economic hubs, and have been transformed by human interventions such as agricultural intensification, modification of water and sediment fluxes, as well as urbanization and industrialization. Additionally, deltas are increasingly affected by the consequences of climate change including sea level rise, and by other natural hazards such as cyclones and storm surges. Five examples of major deltas (Rhine-Meuse, Ganges, Indus, Mekong, and Danube) illustrate the force of human interventions in shaping and transforming deltas and in inducing shifts between four different social-ecological system (SES) states: Holocene, modified Holocene, Anthropocene and 'collapsed'. The three Asian deltas are rapidly changing but whereas SES in the Ganges and Indus deltas are in danger of tipping into a 'collapsed' state, SES in the Mekong delta, which is at the crossroads of various development pathways, could increase in resilience in the future. The Rhine-Meuse and Danube delta examples show that highly managed states may allow, under specific conditions, for interventions leading to increasingly resilient systems. However, little is known about the long-term effects of rapid human interventions in deltas. It is therefore critical to increase the knowledge-base related to SES dynamics and to better characterize social tipping points or turning points in order to avoid unacceptable changes. © 2013 Fabrice G Renaud.},

	abstract = {Scenarios are a useful tool to explore possible futures of social-ecological systems. The number of scenarios has increased dramatically over recent decades, with a large diversity in temporal and spatial scales, purposes, themes, development methods, and content. Scenario archetypes generically describe future developments and can be useful in meaningfully classifying scenarios, structuring and summarizing the overwhelming amount of information, and enabling scientific outputs to more effectively interface with decision-making frameworks. The Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) faced this challenge and used scenario archetypes in its assessment of future interactions between nature and society. We describe the use of scenario archetypes in the IPBES Regional Assessment of Europe and Central Asia. Six scenario archetypes for the region are described in terms of their driver assumptions and impacts on nature (including biodiversity) and its contributions to people (including ecosystem services): Business-as-usual, economic optimism, regional competition, regional sustainability, global sustainable development, and inequality. The analysis shows that trade-offs between nature’s contributions to people are projected under different scenario archetypes. However, the means of resolving these trade-offs depend on differing political and societal value judgements within each scenario archetype. Scenarios that include proactive decision making on environmental issues, environmental management approaches that support multifunctionality, and mainstreaming environmental issues across sectors, are generally more successful in mitigating tradeoffs than isolated environmental policies. Furthermore, those scenario archetypes that focus on achieving a balanced supply of nature’s contributions to people and that incorporate a diversity of values are estimated to achieve more policy goals and targets, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi targets. The scenario archetypes approach is shown to be helpful in supporting science-policy dialogue for proactive decision making that anticipates change, mitigates undesirable trade-offs, and fosters societal transformation in pursuit of sustainable development. © 2019 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The forest-based sector is affected by many profound structural changes and the increasing complexity of the business environment due to, for example, the mature markets of many core products and the aims for bio and circular economies and more sustainable societies. In response to the changing business environment, forest-based sector firms need to restructure their business models and develop new products and services. From the Finnish perspective, new forest-based businesses are crucial in the transition to successful and sustainable bio and circular economies. Views on the concepts of bioeconomy, circular economy and sustainability vary according to which parties are involved. Developing new forest-based sector businesses requires that different actors have knowledge of how each understands these concepts because this creates a basis for commonly accepted goals. This study aims to shed light on how forest-based sector companies understand the concepts of bioeconomy and circular and their linkages to sustainability when transforming their businesses. Semi-structured thematic interviews were conducted with 18 company executives and managers from 17 forest-based sector firms and companies from interfacing sectors, all of which have operations in Finland. The results indicate that there are various understandings of the studied concepts and that they are strongly interlinked. The participating firms often saw themselves as forerunners of circular bioeconomy, highlighting the core role of sustainability and reliance on “reasonable use of wood” and far-reaching, in-depth Finnish expertise in the field. Bioeconomy was usually seen as a response to climate challenge by bio-based, renewable material. The key dichotomy was whether bioeconomy should include traditional, bulk forest-based products or should it be dedicated to new, innovative, higher value-added products only. Another challenge was how to target and guarantee the availability of wood-based biomass for different purposes. Circular economy was characterized by resource efficiency, closed loops, recycling and collaboration. The challenges here was leaning too much on old practices whereas more emphasis should be put on inventing innovative collaborations and products. The sustainability discussion was focused on raw material sustainability and on the importance of Finnish forests as carbon sequesters and the sustainable volumes of wood-biomass utilized, whereas biodiversity went largely unnoticed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change is already occurring globally and will continue to in the future, resulting in significant negative impacts on society and ecosystems in general. Given that climate change is largely caused by humans, and in part by the built environments they create, a logical response may be to consider how buildings can address the drivers of climate change while simultaneously adapting to it. The built environment must move towards being able to sequester carbon and transform greenhouse gases in order to mitigate the causes of climate change where possible. This is alongside more traditional responses to climate change such as improving energy efficiency, reducing the use of fossil fuels to build and maintain urban environments, and designing cities to become more adaptable to future change. This chapter explores how the rapidly expanding field of biomimicry, where living organisms and traits of ecosystems are emulated in design, could make contributions to the evolution of built environments that are able to both sequester and transform carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by careful selection and use of specific materials. A number of examples of different biomimetic materials that are able to improve energy efficiencies, generate renewable energy, or sequester carbon are discussed, along with an ecosystem biomimetic method for materials selection based on understanding and mimicking ecosystem services (i.e., what ecosystems actually do). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

	abstract = {This paper uses advanced time-frequency signal analysis techniques to generate new models for bio-inspired sonar signals. The inspiration comes from the analysis of bottlenose dolphin clicks. These pulses are very short duration, between 50 and 80 μs, but for certain examples we can delineate a double down-chirp structure using fractional Fourier methods. The majority of clicks have energy distributed between two main frequency bands with the higher frequencies delayed in time by 5-20 μs. Signal syntheses using a multiple chirp model based on these observations are able to reproduce much of the spectral variation seen in earlier studies on natural dolphin echolocation pulses. Six synthetic signals are generated and used to drive the dolphin based sonar (DBS) developed through the Biosonar Program office at the SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego, CA. Analyses of the detailed echo structure for these pulses ensonifying two solid copper spherical targets indicate differences in discriminatory potential between the signals. It is suggested that target discrimination could be improved through the transmission of a signal packet in which the chirp structure is varied between pulses. Evidence that dolphins may use such a strategy themselves comes from observations of variations in the transmissions of dolphins carrying out target detection and identification tasks. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract = {Crop losses caused by pests and diseases decrease the incomes and threaten the livelihoods of thousands of families worldwide. A good example of the magnitude of these impacts are the massive crop losses experienced by coffee farmers in Central America due to coffee leaf rust. Coffee farmers need agroecosystems that are capable of regulating the negative impacts of pests and diseases while providing other ecosystem services on which their households and society depend. In this study, we aimed to identify the most promising coffee agroforestry systems for regulating diseases and ensuring the provision of other ecosystem services. During two years, in a research network of 61 coffee plots under a wide variety of shade and management conditions in Turrialba, Costa Rica, we quantified primary and secondary coffee losses (yield and economic losses) and indicators of three other ecosystem services: provisioning of agroforestry products (bananas, plantains, other fruits, and timber), maintenance of soil fertility and carbon sequestration. We then performed an analysis of the relationships between losses and ecosystem service indicators. Based on the results of relationships and on three criteria, we identified the coffee agroforestry systems that had the lowest losses due to diseases and that provided desirable levels of agroforestry products, soil fertility and carbon sequestration. We found multiple significant relationships between losses and ecosystem services (including both tradeoffs and synergies) which allowed us to derive recommendations for better management strategies to reduce yield losses. We identified six coffee agroforestry systems (CAFs) as the most promising ones for reducing losses while simultaneously providing other ecosystem services. One of these CAFs was a simple agroforestry system (dominated by service trees), three were medium diversified CAFs and two were highly diversified CAFs (systems including service trees, timber trees, fruit trees and musaceas). The six CAFS differed in their cropping practices and farmer profitability objectives. The six CAFs offer several options for the design of new coffee plantations or for the transformation of existing plantations. Several of this promising CAFs use little fungicides, which is an indicator that the reduction of chemical inputs could be possible. Our results suggest that the regulation of diseases and associated losses in agroforestry systems should be based on, and take advantage of, the positive effects of plant biodiversity, adequate shade cover, good soil fertility, and minimal use of fungicides. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

There is abundant literature addressing the factors driving habitat loss and fragmentation in the Amazon basin, yet little is known of how cultural and economic changes may be related to landscape change. In this paper, we present a case study of the Tsimane', an indigenous society native to the Bolivian Amazon, to evaluate the relationship between Tsimane' cultural and economic change and the levels of fragmentation and habitat loss in the landscape surrounding their villages. Socioeconomic and cultural data were collected through household surveys (n=778), and landscape metrics for each village (n=59) were derived from a classified Landsat satellite image. We performed spatial analyses and multivariate regressions to study the associations between social and landscape data. Our results suggest that although habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are relatively low in the studied villages, economic change and, to a lesser extent, cultural change mediate transformations in the landscape. To foster both biocultural conservation and the well-being of indigenous people, economic alternatives to intensive land uses should be promoted, considering the needs and institutional arrangements of the Tsimane'.

	abstract = {The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) aims to tackle several challenges on the path towards more sustainable ocean futures. Its central objectives are to close knowledge gaps, increase the usability of scientific knowledge on the ocean, strengthen science-policy interfaces, and make oceanography fit for purpose. The quest for a reflexive turn within ocean science itself echoes many claims for more inclusive, diverse, and equitable research practices in the marine realm and provides an entry point for discussing the contribution of the social sciences to the UN Decade. This article examines different social science research avenues and proposes a research agenda detailing different entry points for unpacking the complex web of science-policy interrelations. First, we identify three research themes - reflexive ocean science, policy-relevant ocean science, and engaged ocean science- and nine research avenues where social science expertise is needed to close knowledge gaps. Second, we use the case of marine biodiversity to illustrate how to combine research into different avenues. Finally, the comprehensive study of ocean science's reflexive, political, and societal dimensions is an emerging field within ocean governance scholarship and deserves to receive increased attention from scholars interested in the conditions of transformative change. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the centuries following the Enlightenment, scientific and technological developments gave 'modern people' an unprecedented ability to understand, predict and control the natural world. This has brought health and social benefits unimaginable to our ancestors and sets us apart from all previous generations. Yet there is a wide-ranging body of evidence that suggests that modernity is now in decline, largely because its methods and mindset are increasingly recognized as unsustainable. Problems are manifest in the emergence of new public health epidemics such as obesity and addictive behaviours, the loss of well-being and increase in anxiety and depression in affluent society, and the persistence of ever-widening health and social inequalities at national and global levels. Still larger problems now confront us, such as climate change, peak oil and the loss of biodiversity, all of which are linked to the 'modern' way of life. We are potentially faced with the collapse of certain aspects of modern society: we are certainly faced with the prospect of inevitable change. While the broad public health community has an important role to play in developing workable solutions to such daunting problems, we argue that some profound changes will be needed in order for us to cope successfully. No blueprints for dealing with change exist, which means that we will need to learn our way into the future. In this paper we take a perspective on the role and nature of the future practitioner in public health and health promotion. We argue that future practitioners will need to develop new ways of thinking, being and doing; new perspectives and new forms of understanding the world. We believe our discipline-and people generally-to be capable of such development, as insights from multiple sources tell us that human nature is malleable, not fixed. We use this analysis to trace, as examples, the imagined lives of five women living in different eras over the course of history in a Western society, and the emergence of different mindsets or worldviews, as the social, economic and cultural context changes. Post-modern analysts might insist that we have no basis for making value judgements between such different worldviews. In this paper, however, we argue that future practitioners should be empathetic to different views and willing to move beyond them, as necessary. We will need to learn and develop in ways that are compatible with our intrinsic needs as human beings and the needs of our ecosystem. We conclude by suggesting just some of the supportive processes of change needed in mapping out a more sustainable future for the public health community. © Royal Society for Public Health 2012.},

	abstract = {For centuries Amazonia has held the Western scientific and popular imagination as a primordial forest, only minimally impacted by small, simple and dispersed groups that inhabit the region. Studies in historical ecology refute this view. Rather than pristine tropical forest, some areas are better viewed as constructed or 'domesticated' landscapes, dramatically altered by indigenous groups in the past. This paper reviews recent archaeological research in several areas along the Amazon River with evidence of large pre-European (ca 400-500 calendar years before the present) occupations and large-scale transformations of forest and wetland environments. Research from the southern margins of closed tropical forest, in the headwaters of the Xingu River, are highlighted as an example of constructed nature in the Amazon. In all cases, human influences dramatically altered the distribution, frequency and configurations of biological communities and ecological settings. Findings of historical change and cultural variability, including diverse small to medium-sized complex societies, have clear implications for questions of conservation and sustainability and, specifically, what constitutes 'hotspots' of bio-historical diversity in the Amazon region. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

Few studies, however, have provided an empirically grounded account of practices employed by sustainability-driven entrepreneurial organizations for sustainability transformations. We address this gap by applying the critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) framework to identify practices for developing organizational and community capacity conducive to sustainability transformations in two cases of sustainability-driven entrepreneurship in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Serra da Capivara National Park, Brazil. We used case study methodology to identify five practices by conducting a reflexive thematic analysis with qualitative data from key informant interviews, documents, and secondary sources. Our results show that each practice was strongly oriented by relational values of care and social–ecological systems thinking. Both humans and nonhumans were taken as stakeholders who participate in and benefit from practices. Caring for the local place, place-based learning, and regenerative organizing appeared to be relevant for learning and development interventions that imparted significant changes in the local social–ecological context. We updated the CHRD framework to incorporate a nonhuman dimension and highlight caring, place-based learning, and regenerative organizing as essential areas of engagement in which HRD practices in support of place-based sustainability transformations occur. © 2022 by the authors.

Forthcoming scenario work holds promise for the Nature Futures Framework, which through the concept of relational values, seeks to recognize a multiplicity of value positions on human-environment relations, including those of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs). The objective of this Perspective paper is to propose a novel scenario skeleton titled “Rights for Life”, which holds promise to achieve ambitious biodiversity targets in a socially-equitable ways by focusing on the Nature's and IPLCs' rights. We demonstrate, through the case of Arctic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) herding, that the “Rights for Life” scenario seems to deliver better social equity outcomes than the recently proposed “Half Earth” and “Sharing the Planet” scenarios that have been designed to achieve ambitious conservation and biodiversity targets. The “Rights for Life” scenario is particularly fit for sparsely-populated indigenous homelands and rural regions where local communities depend on culturally important nature-based livelihoods for their well-being. We recommend that future scenarios targeting human-environment relations should not only consider non-western and relational value perspectives, but also recognize the importance of Nature's and IPLCs' rights for ensuring transformative change for equity and the environment. Clear recognition of such rights can function as a basis for new regulations, market-based governance instruments, policies, and participatory governance instruments ensuring that violation of Nature's and IPLCs' rights by societal developments is recognized, avoided, minimized, or at least compensated for. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the modernization of agriculture in the Western world has contributed not only to a rapid increase in food production but also to environmental and societal concerns over issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, soil quality and biodiversity loss. Many of these concerns, for example those related to animal welfare or labor conditions, are stuck in controversies and apparently deadlocked debates. As a result we observe a paradox in which a wide range of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, originally seeking to reconnect agriculture and society, frequently provoke debate, conflict, and protests. In order to make sense of this pattern, the present paper contends that Western agriculture is marked by moral complexity, i.e., the tendency of multiple legitimate moral standpoints to proliferate without the realistic prospect of a consensus. This contention is buttressed by a conceptual framework that draws inspiration the contemporary business ethics and systems-theoretic scholarship. From the systems-theoretic point of view, the evolution of moral complexity is traced back to the processes of agricultural modernization, specialization, and differentiation, each of which suppresses the responsiveness of the economic and legal institutions to the full range of societal and environmental concerns about agriculture. From the business ethics point of view, moral complexity is shown to prevent the transformation of the ethical responsibilities into the legal and economic responsibilities despite the ongoing institutionalization of CSR. Navigating moral complexity is shown to require moral judgments which are necessarily personal and contestable. These judgments are implicated in those CSR initiatives that require dealing with trade-offs among the different sustainability issues. © 2019, The Author(s).},

The concept of "transformative change" has been gaining more attention to deal with today's environmental and development problems, whereas both policy and scientific communities have been increasingly calling for transformative change toward sustainable society. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has planned to start the so-called "assessment on transformative change" if approved by the IPBES plenary to be held in 2021. At present, the idea of transformative change, including its scope, methodologies, approaches and strategies, are yet to be clarified. By bringing together all of the different concerns and interests in the land/seascape, SEPLS approaches could provide practical and experience-based insights for understanding and gauging transformative change and identifying determinants of such change. This book explores how SEPLS management relates to the idea of transformative change to further the discussion of sustainable transitions in advancing sustainability science. The introductory chapter is followed by case study chapters offering real-world examples of transformative change as well as a synthesis chapter clarifying the relevance of the case study findings to policy and academic discussions. It will be of interest to scholars, policymakers and professionals in the fields related to sustainable development. © UNU-IAS 2021. This book is an open access publication.},

It potentially the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.1 It is predicted to have wide-ranging impacts upon human mental health and well-being, through changes and challenges to people's environment, socioeconomic structures and physical security. Even the most conservative estimates of the health impacts are extremely alarming. Increasingly, the causes of poor human health and environmental damage are related. This implies that there are common solutions. For example, there are co-benefits to human health and biodiversity from mitigating and adapting to climate change (e.g. promoting active transport and reducing car use reduces CO2 emissions, benefits our environment and reduces morbidity and mortality associated with a sedentary lifestyle). This article outlines how climate change impacts upon mental health and well-being. It introduces ecological concepts, applies these to public health and outlines their implications in transforming the way that we prioritize and deliver public health in order to promote both environmental and human health. Evidence, from psychology and neuroscience, suggests that the perception of being disconnected from our inner selves, from each other and from our environment has contributed to poor mental and physical health. We argue that we must transform the way we understand mental health and well-being and integrate it into action against climate change.

	abstract = {In this article, nature is treated as synonymous with the human environment: a complex and dynamic domain comprising animate and inanimate things, terrestrial, atmospheric, and hydrological forces, episodic and persistent features. With reference to three historical accounts of nature in geographically isolated, tropical archipelagos - the Maldives, the Society Islands, and the Seychelles - it is suggested that what the authors understood by 'nature', as well as how they represented it, reflected their understanding of the world and their intellectual stance. The first example dates from early in the fourteenth century and comes from an account of the Maldives by the Islamic geographer, Ibn Battuta. Like other early geographers, Ibn Battuta wrote little about ecology and environment but much about political and social structures. In doing so, he was conforming to Strabo's notion of geographers as the servants of princes. Four centuries later the young British naturalist, Joseph Banks produced a more detailed and fuller account of wild and transformed nature in the Society Islands. It reflected the burgeoning interest in positivist science throughout Western Europe during the second half of the eighteenth century, the influence of Carl Linnaeus, and the growing belief that new ways of thinking were needed if people were to understand nature. An American biogeographer, Jonathan Sauer's account of plants and people on the Seychelles coast exemplifies the comprehensive and scientifically informed approaches of mid-twentieth-century historical geographers interested in nature. Finally, topics that a historical geography of nature should include are identified, practical difficulties are noted, and reasons why the task is a worthy one are given. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are undergoing major transformations due to the establishment and spread of Non-Indigenous Species (NIS). Some of these organisms have adverse effects, for example by reducing biodiversity and causing ecosystem shifts. Others have upsides, such as benefits to fisheries or replacing lost ecological functions and strengthening biogenic complexity. Stopping the spread of NIS is virtually impossible and so the societal challenge is how to limit the socioeconomic, health, and ecological risks, and sustainably exploit the benefits provided by these organisms. We propose a move away from the notion that NIS have only negative effects, and suggest a turn towards an Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management approach for NIS (EBFM-NIS) in the Mediterranean Sea, the world's most invaded marine region. A structured, iterative, and adaptive framework that considers the range of costs and benefits to ecosystems, ecosystem services, and fisheries is set out to determine whether NIS stocks should be managed using sustainable or unsustainable exploitation. We propose fishery reforms such as multiannual plans, annual catch limits, technical measures for sustainable exploitation, and legitimization of unlimited fishing of selected NIS and introduction of a radical new license for NIS fishing for unsustainable exploitation. Depending on local conditions, investment strategies can be included within the EBFM-NIS framework to protect/enhance natural assets to improve ecosystem resilience against NIS, as well as fishery assets to improve the performance of NIS fisheries. Examples of the former include the enhancement of Marine Protected Areas, harvesting of invasive NIS within MPAs, and protection of overfished predators and key species. Examples of the latter include market promotion and valorisation of NIS products, development of novel NIS products, and innovative/alternative NIS fishing such as fishery-related tourism (‘pescatourism’). The application of the suggested EBFM-NIS would create jobs, protect and enhance ecosystem services, and help to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this context, a course dealing with intercultural communication and sustainable leadership that is part of a M.Sc. programme on ICT in Education for Sustainable Development has been developed and is studied in this chapter. The course puts emphasis on the most urgent and critical social, environmental, and economic challenges facing the world and explores how leaders from education, business, government and civil society are responding to global/local sustainability challenges.

It does this by locating sustainability within the leadership literature and presenting a model of sustainability leadership that integrates three complementary types of leadership, namely: distributed; entrepreneurial and transformational.

	abstract = {Soil is the foundation for healthy ecosystems and plays an important role in sustaining life. Soil serves as the baseline for life and provides a variety of ecosystems and societal functions. Despite sustaining the world's demands of food, fibers, and fuels, regulating Earth's air and water quality, and storing greenhouse gases, the value of soil, commonly termed "dirt", is often dismissed. This human disconnect from this important source of life, especially in the middle of our climate crisis, needs to be addressed as a vital sustainability practice. Soil health is largely dependent on a diverse thriving microorganism composition. This unseen world of microorganism biodiversity (diversity of life) can be detected, enumerated, and characterized through advancement in molecular methods such as the use of Environmental DNA (eDNA). This tool takes advantage of DNA found in the environment, from organisms in the form of feces, skin cells, pollen, whole cells (microbes) that can then be collected from soil, sediment, water, and even air! We can use the eDNA from the sample to obtain information on the organisms found in soil from microbes, plants, and vertebrates. From the Greek morphê - shape, and genesis - creation, literally means "the generation of form."Morphogenesis is the process that controls the spatial organization and distribution of cells during the development of an organism. An example of this mechanism includes the transformation of a caterpillar to a butterfly, which demonstrates the ability of an organism's cells to self-organize a new body shape. However, morphogenesis also represents coordinated behavior to build and develop the shape, position, and interconnection of a structure, for example, the replicated pattern of termite mounds. Morphogenesis is a transcending concept that captivates the human imagination. Morphogenesis captures the essence of this project, by expressing how soil can be considered a complex living organism in combination with the computational process of neural cellular automata.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {In the last centuries, gravel-bed rivers in developed countries have undergone rapid changes in channel morphology. The most serious problems include channel transformation related to progressive channel narrowing, incision or bed sediment coarsening. The main reasons for transformations were connected to the human interventions, which affected water and sediment fluxes in the basins. This paper summarizes contemporary research activities focused on these negative effects of channel transformations in the Czech flysch Carpathian rivers (the Morávka, the Olše and the Ostravice draining the highest mountainous areas of the Beskydy Mts). As the result of channel transformations, progressive changes in fluvial ecosystem were observed. The initial phytosociological survey demonstrates a higher biodiversity in the floodplain along the preserved multi-thread river channel than along the deeply incised channel in the Morávka River basin. Our observations of aquatic communities demonstrated that the channel transformation connected with incision and coarsening of bed sediments negatively affected fish or lamprey populations in the studied rivers. Regulation, damming and incision of channels caused changes of hydrological regime linked with gradual drying of floodplain. Additionally, a large set of hydraulic structures, bridges or weirs were affected by undercutting and progressive destruction in the Ostravice, Olše and Morávka River basins, which is assigned to increased transport capacity of regulated channels together with decreased sediment supply from mountainous parts. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

These changes will have significant environmental consequences since fires are a key ecological process in flammable ecosystems with feedbacks on carbon cycling, soil fertility, biodiversity and regional climate patterns. Based on the evolution of fire regimes in Mediterranean biomes, as illustrated by the case of Spain, this article suggests that one of the leading causes of these transformations was the disruption of the pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes (PIAFRs) that helped shape these anthropogenic biomes. State-led industrialization policies and fire exclusion transformed the local communities that generated PIAFRs in all likelihood contributing to today's fire regime changes. In light of the challenges posed by climate change this article suggests that fire governance policies in these biomes should be opened to greater scrutiny and argues for interdisciplinary research into PIAFRs with ABM/LUCC models to further this goal. © Society for Human Ecology.},

	abstract = {Capacity development is increasingly recognized as central to conservation goals. Efforts to develop individual, organizational and societal capacity underpin direct investments in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management, and sustain their impact over time. In the face of urgent needs and increasingly complex contexts for conservation the sector not only needs more capacity development, it needs new approaches to capacity development. The sector is embracing the dynamic relationships between the ecological, political, social and economic dimensions of conservation. Capacity development practitioners should ensure that individuals, organizations and communities are prepared to work effectively in these complex environments of constant change to transform the systems that drive biodiversity loss and unsustainable, unequitable resource use. Here we advocate for a systems view of capacity development. We propose a conceptual framework that aligns capacity development components with all stages of conservation efforts, fosters attention to context, and coordinates with parallel efforts to engage across practitioners and sectors for more systemic impact. Furthermore, we highlight a need for practitioners to target, measure and support vital elements of capacity that have traditionally received less attention, such as values and motivation, leadership and organizational culture, and governance and participation by using approaches from psychology, the social sciences and systems thinking. Drawing from conservation and other sectors, we highlight examples of approaches that can support reflective practice, so capacity development practitioners can better understand the factors that favour or hinder effectiveness of interventions and influence system-wide change.

	abstract = {Epiphytes are diverse and important elements of tropical forests, but as canopy-dwelling organisms, they are highly vulnerable to deforestation. To assess the effect of deforestation on epiphyte diversity and the potential for epiphyte conservation in anthropogenically transformed habitats, we surveyed the epiphytic vegetation of an Ecuadorian cloud forest reserve and its surroundings. Our study was located on the western slopes of the Andes, a global center of biodiversity. We sampled vascular epiphytes of 110 study plots in a continuous primary forest; 14 primary forest fragments; isolated remnant trees in young, middle-aged, and old pastures; and young and old secondary forests. It is the first study to include all relevant types of habitat transformation at a single study site and to compare epiphyte diversity at different temporal stages of fragmentation. Epiphyte diversity was highest in continuous primary forest, followed by forest fragments and isolated remnant trees, and lowest in young secondary forests. Spatial parameters of habitat transformation, such as fragment area, distance to the continuous primary forest, or distance to the forest edge from inside the forest, had no significant effect on epiphyte diversity. Hence, the influence of dispersal limitations appeared to be negligible or appeared to operate only over very short distances, whereas microclimatic edge effects acted only in the case of completely isolated trees, but not in larger forest fragments. Epiphyte diversity increased considerably with age of secondary forests, but species assemblages on isolated remnant trees were impoverished distinctly with time since isolation. Thus, isolated trees may serve for recolonization of secondary forests, but only for a relatively short time. We therefore suggest that the conservation of even small patches of primary forest within agricultural landscape matrices is essential for the long-term maintenance of the high epiphyte diversity in tropical cloud forests. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.},

	abstract = {The Colombian Pacific region is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world, but several anthropic pressures threaten its ecosystems and the ethnic groups who live there. Since the colonial era, the region has experienced two different key strategies of landscape appropriation: (1) diversification of activities in the landscape; and (2) specialisation focusing on a few landscape products. These two strategies fall at opposite ends of a modified continuum over time, including a range of intermediate situations that combine elements of the diversified and specialised strategies. The first strategy is characteristic of Afro-descendant communities, based on harmony with nature and favoring human well-being, while providing multiple ecosystem services and cultural or spiritual values. In this context, this chapter reviews the relationship of Afro-descendants with their environment in the Colombian Pacific region, taking as an example the San Marcos locality. Through interviews with key informants and participant observation, we investigate the productive and extractive practices in San Marcos. Results show that the appropriation strategy combines different sources of income. This denotes a great local ecological knowledge geared to maintenance of biodiversity. Despite Law 70 (1993) stipulating Afro-descendant communities to have guaranteed autonomy and the right to collectively manage their ancestral lands, this socioecological production landscape is endangered due to pressures from the dominant society towards conversion to a specialised strategy. Finally, we also analyse "transformative change" in the context of governance of San Marcos. Such change could guide a profound transformation in conservation strategies based on a fundamental reorientation of human values. © UNU-IAS 2021. This book is an open access publication.},

As examples of dryland agriculture in East Africa and rural energy in Latin America illustrate, such "transformative innovation" needs to give far greater recognition and power to grassroots innovation actors and processes, involving them within an inclusive, multi-scale innovation politics. The three dimensions of direction, diversity, and distribution along with new forms of "sustainability brokering" can help guide the kinds of analysis and decision making now needed to safeguard our planet for current and future generations. © 2012 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The case study described in this paper is part of an emerging cultural context in both its scientific as well as societal aspects, where animals are seen more and more as social and ethical subjects and their presence in the vicinity of humans is seen less and less as a nuisance to be eradicated. It aims to understand the different aspects (material inconveniences, emotional relationships, symbolic value, biodiversity perception, etc.) that hold sway in the relationship between humans and other species in an environment still symbolically seen as separate from any natural process, containing very little biodiversity, and belonging exclusively to humans. This study aims to map out the shared urban ecosystem and show that many of the relationships, coexistence issues, and failures in urban management are connected to semiotic processes that can be transformed. One of the major results of this case study is the emergence of the concept of 'resistance of the semiotic relation': the fact that some semiotic relationships, especially symbolic ones, seem to resist any element or piece of evidence that could be proposed to contradict them. This concept postulates that not all semiotic relations have the same strength or the same resistance to exterior attempts to modify them, and that potential semiotic solutions proposed to improve semiotic relationships, for example in cohabitation situations, need to address this reality and the variety of resistance - or resilience - of different semiotic relations. © 2023 University of Tartu Press.

However, many current agritech products and services address only single needs and do not explicitly draw on the richness of our knowledge in plant and ecological sciences. These limitations can be addressed through digital twins, which are increasingly being adopted across diverse fields to monitor, analyse, simulate and control complex systems. In this paper we describe the approach The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited (Plant & Food Research) is adopting to develop a digital twin to leverage the transformative opportunities offered through the purposeful integration of biology and digital technologies. Our goal is to dynamically couple physical components of apple production and supply chain systems with their virtual analogues. The digital twin will direct sensors and external interfaces to obtain input data from the real world, and prescribe optimal interventions based on models that robustly simulate the impact of selected biotic and abiotic stresses on key physiological, ecological and quality modifying processes. We are approaching this task through a series of tightly coordinated research programmes organised around the themes of: building the digital ecosystem; new models of the perennial horticulture ecosystem; and developing and deploying digital twins. We expect that this digital twin can offer new opportunities to increase the profitability, resilience and sustainability of perennial crop systems. © 2023 International Society for Horticultural Science.

These omnipresent diseases (e.g., asthma, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes) have no cultural, geographical, or socio-economic boundaries and they impact all age groups including children and young adults. Local and national authorities North and South of the Equator, and international organizations and networks, have rarely responded effectively to children's health challenges in the context of rapid urban development. The purpose of this article is to describe and illustrate more effective approaches. It proposes new ideas, founded on collective thinking involving several disciplines and professions, and new working methods, founded on collaboration with community associations in civil society. Both promote shared understandings about the complex, dynamic, systemic, and emergent nature of urban health risks for children. The article explains why transdisciplinary contributions should be distinguished from multi- and inter-disciplinary contributions, and it presents examples of participatory action research in the WHO European region about children's health. © 2019 by the authors.},

Now, few can credibly question the transformational impact of technology on efforts to digitize scientific collections, as IT now reaches into almost every nook and cranny of society. Five to ten years ago this was not the case. Digitization is an activity that museums and academic institutions increasingly recognize, though many still do not embrace, as a means to boost the impact of collections to research and society through improved access. The acquisition and use of scientific collections is a global endeavor, and digitization enhances their value by improved access to core biodiversity information, increases use, relevance and potential downstream value, for example, in the management of natural resources, policy development, food security, and planetary and human health. This paper examines new opportunities to design and implement infrastructure that will support not just mass digitization efforts, but also a broad range of research on biological diversity and physical sciences in order to make scientific collections increasingly relevant to societal needs and interest. © Reed S.

	abstract = {Public catering has become increasingly important in recent years. With increasing annual customers, the sector’s impact on the environment is also growing continuously. At the same time, public catering offers a lever to promote sustainable nutrition that has rarely been used so far. Small changes in kitchen practices and food offers can thus be multiplied into a significant positive impact on environmental challenges, such as climate change or loss of biodiversity due to the large number of servings. In contrast to private households, management decisions in public catering can influence the food-related environmental impact of thousands of customers. This article deals with the nationwide level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resource use in the German public catering segment “business” and its saving potentials by different scenarios of unsupported and supported recipe revision. In this paper, we define "unsupported" as the intuitive optimization of recipes by employees of public catering businesses. In contrast, “supported” approaches had to meet specific target goals, for example of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ernährung; engl. German Nutrition Society or the sustainable level. Specifically, we will test how (A) an unsupported recipe revision, (B) a recipe revision based on dietary recommendations and (C) a recipe revision using scientific guidance affect the environmental impact of a dish. As a methodological framework, an online survey of public catering companies was conducted as well as a scenario analysis at menu level and at nationwide level. The results are based on empirical data on the one hand, and on extrapolations on the other. The results show that the nationwide implementation of recipe revision according to scientific guidance—such as concrete target goals for the GHG emissions per serving—can save up to 44% of resource use in the German business catering sector (which corresponds to 3.4 million tons of resources per year) and as much as 40% of GHG emissions (0.6 million tons GHG emissions per year). Even in the scenario of unsupported recipe revision, GHG and resource savings of up to 20% can be realized. The results show that public catering can reduce its material and carbon footprint by 20% overnight. Moreover, the findings show indications for the sustainable transformation of public catering. Nevertheless, it must be noted that these are some first steps of the transformation, which will require further changes with even greater impacts and political activities. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {State-led policies of pastoralist removal from protected areas, following the fortress model of biodiversity conservation, have been a common practice across parts of Asia and Africa. In the Himalayan region of South Asia, restrictive access and removal of pastoralist communities from protected areas have been compensated by the state through “eco”-tourism. In this paper, we critique the current conservation model adopted in the Indian Himalaya, which focuses on a conservation-pastoral eviction-ecotourism coupling. With a focus on pastoralists and pastoral practices, we argue that this model is neither an inclusive engine of development, nor does it always help conservation. Instead, it recreates a landscape favoring the state's interests, produces exclusions, and may also negatively affect both society and ecology. We build on the case of Khangchendzonga National Park (KNP) situated in Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya. We used mixed methods and conducted 48 semi-structured interviews, 10 key informant interviews, and two focused group discussion in the four village clusters situated in the vicinity of KNP, West Sikkim. The grazing ban policy and concomitant promotion of tourism caused the end of pastoralism in KNP. It transformed a pastoral cultural landscape into a tourist spot with a transition in livestock from the traditional herds of yak and sheep to the pack animals and non-native hybrid cattle. Locally perceived social impacts of the grazing ban include loss of pastoral culture, economic loss, and the exclusion of the pastoral community from the park. As per the respondents, perceived ecological effects include a decline in vegetation diversity in the high-altitude summer pastures, altered vegetation composition in the winter due to plantation of non-native tree species, and increased incidents of human-wildlife conflict. Rangelands of the Himalaya transcend political boundaries across countries. The conservation model in Himalaya, should henceforth be done with a trans-boundary level planning involving the prime users of high-altitude rangelands, i.e., the pastoralists. The lessons from this study can help design effective future policy interventions in landscapes critical for both pastoralist cultures and wildlife conservation. © Copyright © 2021 Singh, Sharma, Bhutia, Bhutia and Babu.},

	abstract = {Ecological baselines-reference states of species' distributions and abundances-are key to the scientific arguments underpinning many conservation and management interventions, as well as to the public support to such interventions. Yet societal as well as scientific perceptions of these baselines are often based on ecosystems that have been deeply transformed by human actions. Despite increased awareness about the pervasiveness and implications of this shifting baseline syndrome, ongoing global assessments of the state of biodiversity do not take into account the long-term, cumulative, anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity. Here, we propose a new framework for documenting such impacts, by classifying populations according to the extent to which they deviate from a baseline in the absence of human actions. We apply this framework to the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) to illustrate how it can be used to assess populations with different geographies and timelines of known or suspected impacts. Through other examples, we discuss how the framework can be applied to populations for which there is a wide diversity of existing knowledge, by making the best use of the available ecological, historical and archaeological data. Combined across multiple populations, this framework provides a standard for assessing cumulative anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.

	abstract = {Large-scale ecological restoration is crucial for effective biodiversity conservation and combating climate change. However, perspectives on the goals and values of restoration are highly diverse, as are the different approaches to restoration e.g. ranging from the restoration of cultural ecosystems to rewilding. We assess how the future of nature is envisioned in participatory scenarios, focusing on which elements of rewilding and nature contributions to people have been considered in scenario narratives across Europe. We used the Nature Futures Framework archetypes as a template to synthesize pluralistic perspectives of nature. We found that different values of nature are often represented as counteracting elements and fail to integrate the plural views of nature. Nature as Culture was the main archetype found in the scenarios, usually associated with positive impacts on the non-material benefits to people. Intrinsic values of nature (i.e., Nature for Nature) were associated with positive impacts on regulating benefits and negative impacts on material benefits, being the only archetype of future associated with positive impacts on all three components of rewilding. Nature for Society was associated with moderate positive impacts on material and regulatory nature contributions to people. Business as usual futures were associated with negative impacts on regulating and non-material benefits to people and on all three components of rewilding. Our results highlight two major gaps in the scenarios that should be addressed in participatory restoration planning and models. Firstly, there is a paucity of spatially explicit approaches, with most studies failing to transform the results of participatory scenario planning into model projections. Secondly, we found scenarios that explored co-benefits between multiple nature perspectives were overall missing from the literature. Novel scenario narratives and approaches that explore synergies among different nature values are needed to design future large-scale restoration where biodiversity recovery and human well-being are intrinsically linked and fostered. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The current climate debate focuses on how to reach net zero latest by 2050. Most transformation pathways rely on negative emissions to compensate “hard-to-avoid” emissions, for example in aviation, industry or livestock farming. However, even a constant global heating at 1.5 °C may trigger climate tipping points, such as the loss of cryosphere, permafrost or ecosystems. It therefore becomes necessary to achieve “below zero” with large-scale negative emissions, reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate forcing. This paper argues for a systemic view and shows with a comparison of past, current and future carbon stocks and flows that storing the minimally necessary removals will already be challenging. Consequently, continued fossil emissions shall be avoided completely, as their compensation increases removals and binds societal resources. For delivering the required scale and speed of negative emissions, scalable technical solutions will have to developed, as bio-based solutions are limited though essential for reverting land use impacts and safeguarding biodiversity. In this context, it is important to investigate the potential of a circular carbon economy, storing carbon in safe and reliable material cycles. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The arid desert coast of northern Peru has traditionally been viewed either as existing in stasis, or as experiencing punctuated change from sudden flood events, followed by a return to system equilibrium. Despite these environmental extremes, the region was home to agriculture-based societies for millennia, and the success of these farming systems is considered an early example of irrigation technology transforming marginal landscapes. However, a closer examination of the long-term human-environment history of the Chicama Valley, one of the largest valleys in the coastal region, demonstrates that this landscape is the product of protracted interactions across at least three systems: the local environment, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and farming. Here, El Niño floods, typically considered high-risk events, are fundamental to local biodiversity and renewal, resulting in a desert ecosystem that is both robust and elastic. The prehispanic farmland known as the Pampa de Mocan (1100BC–AD1460), is presented as a case study to observe the co-evolution of agricultural technology and an ENSO-hyper-arid environment. This ancient farming system developed the capacity to toggle between sudden floodwater inputs and periods of water scarcity. Alongside water and soil conservation practices, prehispanic agriculturalists implemented technologies that were designed to mitigate El Niño flooding and incorporate its byproducts to supplement available resources. The convergence of these interacting systems on the Pampa de Mocan offers new insights into the role of risk in building resilience. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Today, remnant habitats of this management history, such as wooded pastures and meadows, are the focus of conservation programs, due to their rich biodiversity and cultural and aesthetic values. After a review of historical niche construction processes, the paper examines current niche construction affecting these old cultural landscapes. Features produced by historical niche construction, e.g., landscape composition and species richness, are in the modern society reinterpreted to become values associated with beauty and heritage and species' intrinsic values. These non-utilitarian motivators now become drivers of new niche construction dynamics, manifested as conservation programs. The paper also examines the possibility to maintain and create new habitats, potentially associated with values emanating from historical landscapes, but in transformed and urbanized landscapes. © 2016 by the author.},

	abstract = {Legacies are persistent changes in natural systems resulting from human activities. Legacies that affect river ecosystems can result from human alterations outside of the river corridor, such as timber harvest or urbanization, or from alterations within the river corridor, including flow regulation, river engineering, and removal of large wood and beaver dams. Human alterations of river ecosystems have been occurring for thousands of years in some parts of the world and are now ubiquitous, yet both river scientists and the public may be unaware of the persistent effects of historical activities. Failure to recognize the legacy of historical activities that no longer occur can skew perceptions of river process and form and the natural range of variability in river ecosystems. Examples come from rivers of the Mid-Atlantic Piedmont and the Pacific Northwest regions of the United States. Mid-Atlantic Piedmont streams in which legacy sediment accumulated behind now-abandoned mill dams experienced a complete transformation from wide, shallow, marshy valleys to sinuous rivers lined with tall cutbanks, but the existence and the cause of this river metamorphosis was not widely recognized until the first decade of the 21st century. Rivers of the Pacific Northwest from which large wood was removed have changed during the past century from spatially heterogeneous, multichannel systems closely connected to their floodplains via frequent channel avulsion and lateral migration to single-thread channels with more homogeneous floodplains and less lateral connectivity. Again, this river metamorphosis has only been recognized within the past two decades. In each of these regional examples, river process and form have changed so substantially that the river ecosystems can be described as having assumed an alternative state. In these and many other examples, the alternative state provides lower levels of ecosystem services such as habitat, biodiversity, and attenuation of downstream fluxes of water, sediment, organic carbon, and nutrients. River management designed to enhance and restore these ecosystem services can be more effective if the continuing effects of these historical legacies are recognized. The grand scientific challenges resulting from historical human alterations of river ecosystems include the following: (1) to recognize the existence of a legacy that continues to affect river ecosystem process and form; (2) to understand the source of the legacy with respect to chronology, type, spatial extent, and intensity of human activities; (3) to understand the implications of the legacy regarding how river process and form and river ecosystem services have changed; and (4) to design management or restoration strategies that can mitigate the loss of river ecosystem services. In summary, the existence of forgotten legacies challenges river scientists to recognize the continuing effects of human activities that have long since ceased and also poses challenges for the application of scientific understanding to resource management. Societal expectations for attractive, simple, stable rivers are commonly at odds with scientific understanding of rivers as dynamic, spatially heterogeneous, nonlinear ecosystems. Knowledge of how human actions, including historical actions that have long since ceased, continue to alter river ecosystems can help to bridge the gap between societal and scientific perceptions of rivers. ©2019.

Arguably, only strong sustainable consumption governance methods can bring about changes at the scale and speed required. This article discusses one emerging policy tool within strong governance, namely consumption corridors which could bring about absolute reductions in the negative impacts of consumption in a just manner and using deliberative democracy. Consumption corridors are applied in the context of the current meat system, a common driver for the twin crises, and an issue central to achieving the sustainable development, biodiversity, and Paris climate goals. The recently developed planetary health diet offers a useful plan for the transformation of global food systems, and could be combined with sustainable consumption corridors for meat. Systems thinking identifies change in societal paradigms as most effective. To support such change, this article suggests two metaphors as discourse tools, whereby individual and societal transformation in meat consumption occurs as a journey along a continuum of different meatways. The article also suggests specific actions for bringing about meat consumption corridors, and argues that this context could also serve as a bridge for increased societal acceptance of recomposed consumption. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Earth's natural systems represent a growing threat to human health. And yet, global health has mainly improved as these changes have gathered pace. What is the explanation? As a Commission, we are deeply concerned that the explanation is straightforward and sobering: we have been mortgaging the health of future generations to realise economic and development gains in the present. By unsustainably exploiting nature's resources, human civilisation has fl ourished but now risks substantial health eff ects from the degradation of nature's life support systems in the future. Health eff ects from changes to the environment including climatic change, ocean acidifi cation, land degradation, water scarcity, overexploitation of fi sheries, and biodiversity loss pose serious challenges to the global health gains of the past several decades and are likely to become increasingly dominant during the second half of this century and beyond. These striking trends are driven by highly inequitable, ineffi cient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, together with population growth. We identify three categories of challenges that have to be addressed to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends. Firstly, conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges), such as an over-reliance on gross domestic product as a measure of human progress, the failure to account for future health and environmental harms over present day gains, and the disproportionate eff ect of those harms on the poor and those in developing nations. Secondly, knowledge failures (research and information challenges), such as failure to address social and environmental drivers of ill health, a historical scarcity of transdisciplinary research and funding, together with an unwillingness or inability to deal with uncertainty within decision making frameworks. Thirdly, implementation failures (governance challenges), such as how governments and institutions delay recognition and responses to threats, especially when faced with uncertainties, pooled common resources, and time lags between action and eff ect. Although better evidence is needed to underpin appropriate policies than is available at present, this should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Substantial potential exists to link action to reduce environmental damage with improved health outcomes for nations at all levels of economic development. This Commission identifi es opportunities for action by six key constituencies: health professionals, research funders and the academic community, the UN and Bretton Woods bodies, governments, investors and corporate reporting bodies, and civil society organisations. Depreciation of natural capital and nature's subsidy should be accounted for so that economy and nature are not falsely separated. Policies should balance social progress, environmental sustainability, and the economy. To support a world population of 9-10 billion people or more, resilient food and agricultural systems are needed to address both undernutrition and overnutrition, reduce waste, diversify diets, and minimise environmental damage. Meeting the need for modern family planning can improve health in the short termeg, from reduced maternal mortality and reduced pressures on the environment and on infrastructure. Planetary health off ers an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy of global and national reforms of taxes and subsidies for many sectors of the economy, including energy, agriculture, water, fi sheries, and health. Regional trade treaties should act to further incorporate the protection of health in the near and long term. Several essential steps need to be taken to transform the economy to support planetary health. These steps include a reduction of waste through the creation of products that are more durable and require less energy and materials to manufacture than those often produced at present; the incentivisation of recycling, reuse, and repair; and the substitution of hazardous materials with safer alternatives. Despite present limitations, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a great opportunity to integrate health and sustainability through the judicious selection of relevant indicators relevant to human wellbeing, the enabling infrastructure for development, and the supporting natural systems, together with the need for strong governance. The landscape, ecosystems, and the biodiversity they contain can be managed to protect natural systems, and indirectly, reduce human disease risk. Intact and restored ecosystems can contribute to resilience (see panel 1 for glossary of terms used in this report), for example, through improved coastal protection (eg, through wave attenuation) and the ability of fl oodplains and greening of river catchments to protect from river fl ooding events by diverting and holding excess water. The growth in urban populations emphasises the importance of policies to improve health and the urban environment, such as through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, provision of green space, and urban planning to prevent sprawl and decrease the magnitude of urban heat islands. Transdisciplinary research activities and capacity need substantial and urgent expansion. Present research limitations should not delay action. In situations where technology and knowledge can deliver win-win solutions and co-benefi ts, rapid scale-up can be achieved if researchers move ahead and assess the implementation of potential solutions. Recent scientifi c investments towards understanding non-linear state shifts in ecosystems are very important, but in the absence of improved understanding and predictability of such changes, eff orts to improve resilience for human health and adaptation strategies remain a priority. The creation of integrated surveillance systems that collect rigorous health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defi ned populations over long time periods can provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden. The improvement of risk communication to policy makers and the public and the support of policy makers to make evidence-informed decisions can be helped by an increased capacity to do systematic reviews and the provision of rigorous policy briefs. Health professionals have an essential role in the achievement of planetary health: working across sectors to integrate policies that advance health and environmental sustainability, tackling health inequities, reducing the environmental impacts of health systems, and increasing the resilience of health systems and populations to environmental change. Humanity can be stewarded successfully through the 21st century by addressing the unacceptable inequities in health and wealth within the environmental limits of the Earth, but this will require the generation of new knowledge, implementation of wise policies, decisive action, and inspirational leadership.},

	abstract = {Explaining the distribution of a species by using local environmental features is a long-standing ecological problem. Often, available data are collected as a set of presence locations only, thus precluding the possibility of a desired presence-absence analysis. We propose that it is natural to view presence-only data as a point pattern over a region and to use local environmental features to explain the intensity driving this point pattern. We use a hierarchical model to treat the presence data as a realization of a spatial point process, whose intensity is governed by the set of environmental covariates. Spatial dependence in the intensity levels is modelled with random effects involving a zero-mean Gaussian process. We augment the model to capture highly variable and typically sparse sampling effort as well as land transformation, both of which degrade the point pattern. The Cape Floristic Region in South Africa provides an extensive class of such species data. The potential (i.e. non-degraded) presence surfaces over the entire area are of interest from a conservation and policy perspective. The region is divided into about 37000 grid cells. To work with a Gaussian process over a very large number of cells we use a predictive spatial process approximation. Bias correction by adding a heteroscedastic error component has also been implemented. We illustrate with modelling for six different species. Also, a comparison is made with the now popular Maxent approach though it is limited with regard to inference. The resultant patterns are important on their own but also enable a comparative view, for example, to investigate whether a pair of species are potentially competing in the same area. An additional feature of our modelling is the opportunity to infer about biodiversity through species richness, i.e. the number of distinct species in an areal unit. Such an investigation immediately follows within our modelling framework. © 2011 Royal Statistical Society.},

In that context, Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture (UPA), thanks to its multifunctionality, could have a high value in providing social, economic, and environmental co-benefits. UPA is an emerging field of research and production that aims to improve food security and climate change impact reduction, improving urban resilience and sustainability. In this paper, a replicable GIS-based approach was used to localize and quantify available areas for agriculture, including both flat rooftop and ground-level areas in the mainland of the city of Venice (Italy). Then, possible horticultural yield production was estimated considering common UPA yield value and average Italian consumption. Climate change mitigation, like CO2 reduction and sequestration, and climate change adaptation, like Urban Flooding and Urban Heat Island reduction, due to the new UPA areas’ development were estimated. Despite the urban density, the identified areas have the potential to produce enough vegetables for the residents and improve climate change mitigation and adaptation, if transformed into agricultural areas. Finally, the paper concludes with a reflection on the co-benefits of UPA multifunctionality, and with some policy suggestions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The global nature-climate crisis along with a fundamental shift in world population towards cities and towns has sharpened the focus on the role of urban green infrastructure. Green infrastructure has the potential to deliver cost-effective, naturebased solutions to help mitigate problems of climate change as well as provide improved human well-being through the ecosystem services inherent in landscapes rich in biodiversity. The absence of under-pinning science, specifically complex systems science and ecosystem theory in the design and planning of urban green infrastructure, has limited the capacity of these landscapes to deliver ecosystem services and to effectively demonstrate natural resilience to the impacts of climate change. To meet future challenges of environmental uncertainty and social change, the design of urban green space should embrace an adaptive ecosystem-based approach that includes fully integrated participatory planning and implementation strategies founded on principles of close to nature science. Our article offers two models to inform green space planning: urban green space framework and sustainable urban community network. Both concepts provide the foundation for six ecosystem-based design principles. In a case study on Essex green infrastructure, UK, recommendations made by the Essex Climate Action Commission to transform land management practices are presented as examples of adopting principles of the ecosystem approach and nature-based science. Our article concludes by emphasising the importance of reconnecting society with nature in cities through close-to-nature design of urban green space to secure essential ecosystem services and to build resilience to the impacts of climate change. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

	abstract = {In this article, nature is treated as synonymous with the human environment: a complex and dynamic domain comprising animate and inanimate things, terrestrial, atmospheric, and hydrological forces, and episodic and persistent features. With reference to three historical accounts of nature in geographically isolated, tropical archipelagos—the Maldives, the Society Islands, and the Seychelles—it is suggested that what the authors understood by “nature,” as well as how they represented it, reflected their understanding of the world and their intellectual stance. The first example dates from early in the 14th Century and comes from an account of the Maldives by the Islamic geographer, Ibn Battuta. Like other early geographers, Ibn Battuta wrote little about ecology and environment but much about political and social structures. In doing so, he was conforming to Strabo's notion of geographers as the servants of princes. Four centuries later, the young British naturalist, Joseph Banks produced a more detailed and fuller account of wild and transformed nature in the Society Islands. It reflected the burgeoning interest in positivist science throughout Western Europe during the second half of the 18th Century, the influence of Carl Linnaeus, and the growing belief that new ways of thinking were needed if people were to understand nature. An American biogeographer, Jonathan Sauer's account of plants and people on the Seychelles coast exemplifies the comprehensive and scientifically informed approaches of mid-20th-Century historical geographers interested in nature. Finally, topics that a historical geography of nature should include are identified, practical difficulties are noted, and reasons why the task is a worthy one are given. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Fish populations globally are susceptible to endangerment through exploitation and habitat loss. We present theoretical simulations to explore how reduced adult survival (age truncation) might affect short-lived freshwater fish species in human-altered contemporary environments. Our simulations evaluate two hypothetical "average fish" and five example fish species of age 1 or age 2 maturity. From a population equilibrium baseline representing a natural, unaltered environment we impose systematic reductions in adult survival and quantify how age truncation affects the causes of variation in population growth rate. We estimate the relative contributions to population growth rate arising from simulated temporal variation in age-specific vital rates and population structure. At equilibrium and irrespective of example species, population structure (first adult age class) and survival probability of the first two adult age classes are the most important determinants of population growth. As adult survival decreases, the first reproductive age class becomes increasingly important to variation in population growth. All simulated examples show the same general pattern of change with age truncation as known for exploited, longer-lived fish species in marine and freshwater environments. This implies age truncation is a general potential concern for fish biodiversity across life history strategies and ecosystems. Managers of short-lived, freshwater fishes in contemporary environments often focus on supporting reproduction to ensure population persistence. However, a strong focus on water management to support reproduction may reduce adult survival. Sustainability management needs a focus on mitigating adult mortality in human-altered ecosystems. A watershed spatial extent embracing land and water uses may be necessary to identify and mitigate causes of age truncation in freshwater species. Achieving higher adult survival will require paradigm transformations in society and government about water management priorities. © 2020 Hatch et al.

	abstract = {Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives - either economic or social norms, or both - can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Instead, these processes are interpreted as disruptions in the planned course of action. We illustrate our viewpoint with an empirical example from Finland. The case is about a significant spot of biodiversity in a completely man-made environment. The study serves as an example of how artefacts actively co-shape the events and environment around them and thus create a relationship between humans and their surroundings.

	abstract = {There is growing scientific and public recognition that human actions, directly and indirectly, have profoundly changed the Earth system, in a still accelerating process, increasingly called the “Anthropocene”. Planetary transformation, including of the atmosphere, climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, has enormous implications for human health, many of which are deeply disturbing, especially in low-income settings. A few health consequences of the Anthropocene have been partially recognized, including within environmental epidemiology, but their long-term consequences remain poorly understood and greatly under-rated. For example Syria could be a “sentinel” population, giving a glimpse to a much wider dystopian future. Health-Earth is a research network, co-founded in 2014, which seeks, with other groups, to catalyse a powerful curative response by the wider health community. This paper builds on a symposium presented by Health-Earth members at the 2015 conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. It reviews and synthesizes parts of the large literature relevant to the interaction between the changing Earth system and human health. It concludes that this topic should be prominent within future environmental epidemiology and public health.

	abstract = {Global changes with regards to climate, environment, economy and society may cause serious problems and in the meantime also challenges for terrestrial ecosystems. Example global changes include greenhouse effects, ozone depletion, acid deposition, drought and waterlogging frequency, higher and lower temperature duration, soil acidity and degradation, soil polluted with heavy metals, sharp decline of forest area and species diversity etc. It is well documented that biogeography environments and climates play key roles in species distribution, while global changes affect the distribution and utilization of species resources. As the most intimate partner to plants, mycorrhizal fungi are also seriously influenced. Mycorrhizal fungi which colonize plant roots and form symbiosis with host plants, occupy irreplaceable niche. Mycorrhizal associations specifically arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), ectomycorrhiza (ECM), ectoendomycorrhiza (EEM), ericoid mycorrhizas (ERM), and/or orchid mycorrhizas (OM), interact with other organisms living both in soil and on the ground, incorporate nutrient transforming, absorption, circulation and utilization. They play vital roles in maintaining atmospheric compositions, adjusting terrestrial ecosystems, increasing biodiversities, stabilizing sustainable productivities as well as sustainable development of human society. Thus, exploration of the function and functioning mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungi under global changes is a complete new subject, especially, the study on biological mechanisms to global changes is of realistic value and profound scientific significance. This paper introduces the impact of global changes on mycorrhizal fungi, particularly the influence of greenhouse effects, CO2 level increasing, ozone depletion, acid with nitrogen and sulfur deposition, drought and waterlogging, exotic plant invasion, and human activities on mycorrhizal fungus development and functions. We summarized the possible functions of mycorrhizal fungi under global changes through direct and indirect pathways, such as rehabilitating and stabilizing the damaged, degraded and fragile ecosystems, deceasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, increasing carbon sink, enhancing substance conversion, circulation and utilization, resisting to plant pathogens and pest insects, conferring biological stresses, and playing some roles in exotic plant invasion and succession. The authors also reviewed the functioning mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungi under global changes. It was suggested that mycorrhizal fungi may synergistically function with the other organisms, strengthening their own and host plant physiological and ecological characteristics, enlarging hyphae net, and secreting and inducing beneficial substances. Therefore the position, role, function and mechanisms of mycorrhizal fungi under global changes, especially the evolution characters of mycorrhizal fungi and mycorrhizas, the role and functions of mycorrhizal fungi under global changes and possible mechanisms of responses of mycorrhizal fungi to the global changes, should be paid more attention to. This knowledge may be helpful for better understanding of the comprehensive responses of terrestrial ecosystems to global changes, and for providing basis for further investigation on this topics and possible pathways to control agricultural pests. © 2014, Science Press.

It identifies the intellectual and organisational limits that prevent IR from effectively addressing the planet's new geological conditions and highlights the urgency of developing a politics for the Earth, suggesting possible pathways for the future. Four major limitations are addressed, namely IR's state-centrism, which precludes it from building the necessary planetary picture of reality; positivist and rationalist paradigms, whose assumptions of a stable and predictable world hinder the field and policymakers' capacity to recognize non-linearity and uncertainty; the nature-society dichotomy, a core dogma of the prevailing scholarship and politics; and anthropocentrism, which ignores the entanglement of human and non-human life. The cases of climate tipping points and the water and biodiversity crises are used to illustrate the Anthropocene's distinctive character and the urgency of rethinking and transforming IR's prevailing beliefs and practices, so that they match the planetary real. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

	abstract = {Fossil discoveries over the past 30 years have radically transformed traditional views of Mesozoic mammal evolution. In addition, recent research provides a more detailed account of the Cretaceous diversification of flowering plants. Here, we examine patterns of morphological disparity and functional morphology associated with diet in early mammals. Two analyses were performed: (i) an examination of diversity based on functional dental type rather than higher-level taxonomy, and (ii) a morphometric analysis of jaws, which made use of modern analogues, to assess changes in mammalian morphological and dietary disparity. Results demonstrate a decline in diversity of molar types during the mid-Cretaceous as abundances of triconodonts, symmetrodonts, docodonts and eupantotherians diminished. Multituberculates experience a turnover in functional molar types during the mid-Cretaceous and a shift towards plant-dominated diets during the late Late Cretaceous. Although therians undergo a taxonomic expansion coinciding with the angiosperm radiation, they display small body sizes and a low level of morphological disparity, suggesting an evolutionary shift favouring small insectivores. It is concluded that during the mid-Cretaceous, the period of rapid angiosperm radiation, mammals experienced both a decrease in morphological disparity and a functional shift in dietary morphology that were probably related to changing ecosystems. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

The presence of the Andean lapwing demonstrates the intricate linkages between culture and nature in the Andean region. I highlight a paradox of conservation, using the Andean lapwing as the avian indicator of global environmental change as an example of the contest between landscape change, biodiversity, and ethnoecological insights.

	abstract = {Silo-ed thinking, fragmented knowledge systems and short-termism remain key challenges in transforming urban systems and policy making towards more sustainable and resilient cities. Innovative strategies and actions which seek to drive agendas of change are often stuck in established and inflexible planning or policy structures. Complex issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss or socio-economic disparities require the attention of a variety of stakeholders from public, private and academic sectors and civil society. To meet this challenge, some cities have recognised that new knowledge networks and forms of collaboration are needed to meet this challenge. Urban knowledge exchanges are increasingly discussed and practiced as boundary-spanning platforms to bridging knowledge gaps and catalyse innovative forms of cross-sectoral communication, cooperative learning and action. To understand this new form of intermediation, this paper systematically analyses 26 international examples of urban knowledge exchanges. By comparing their organisational structures and approaches of knowledge sharing and translation, the analysis shows that there are several differing models globally that are adopted to respond to the challenge of knowledge fragmentation. The identified key features include: inclusive knowledge co-production, openness of interaction around a boundary object, ongoing monitoring and evaluation and the sustained investment of time in the institution. © 2022 The Authors},

Among other reasons - e.g. a deficit in national implementation - lack of coherence among a variety of overlapping and sometimes contradictory international institutions is considered as one major cause which needs to be overcome. In this article, however, it is argued that this lack of coherence is not a result of a lack of cooperation but a form of governance failure strongly connected with the political and economic structures of global capitalism and its ongoing neoliberal-imperial transformation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this governance failure is a by-product of the articulation of sometimes antagonistic interests and related power relations inscribed in different national and international institutions. Building on the concept of societal relationships with nature, on historical-materialist state theory and its perspective of the internationalization of the state as well as on the regulation approach, the paper analyzes the tension between different international institutions in order to understand the actual transformations towards a post-Fordist governance of nature. The empirical issues dealt with are different international regulations concerning the appropriation of genetic resources, especially the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). © 2008 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is a heritage for the human being. The biotic components and the interactions between them offer different resources and ecosystem services such as fiber, food, wood, pest and disease control, pollination, economic income and artistic inspiration, among many others. Chile is a biogeographic island whose biota has a high percentage of endemism due to their physical barriers that have modulated its biodiversity. However, since the decade of the 70s, the country underwent a serious transformation of the natural landscapes due to the neoliberal economic policies which have been perpetuated over time, especially in the center-south of Chile. Threats such as the development of the forest industry, agriculture and avocado plantations, mining and livestock have been important drivers in these transformations. Currently, the greatest biodiversity is mainly found in the hotspot of central Chile. However, this is an area with a high contrast. On the one hand, it is where most human impacts occur, and on the other hand, it is where the major concentration of endemic and threatened species, and potential ecosystem functions are concentrated. These have not been adequately managed and evaluated. Some reasons lie on the high degree of centralism present in the country, for example, most centers of study and monitoring of biodiversity are geographically centralized, limiting the geographical scope of their investigation. Other reasons lie on the high economic cost necessary to develop conservation plans; historical care for the environment has been relegated to the background. In addition, most national protected areas are unequally distributed, and are geographically isolated to areas with low population density. Given this scenario, our chapter is focused on showing biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functions, and where, the risk of human activities has a greater impact on the Chilean biota. In addition, based on these patterns and processes, some gaps have been identified to be addressed and considered in the design of conservation strategies in the future. A total of seven drivers were identified in the near future and they should be considered as threats to biodiversity in Chile. Thus, a holistic way to address them in order to protect our natural heritage is proposed. These drivers are: (1) the crisis of the taxonomy, it is financing, and its transdisciplinarity; (2) land use planning and site planning for production, urbanization and conservation; (3) slaughter areas and their environmental and social effects; (4) the re-nationalization of water as a fundamental right; (5) the establishment of education programs on biodiversity; (6) the re-connection with nature by society and (7) the management of plastic waste in the future. © 2019 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Part I offers an overview of the six scenarios developed by the GSG and a short discussion of significant papers published by the Great Transition Initiative (GTI) of the Tellus Institute. Next come examples of dramatic historical and current transitions in Western Europe, the USA, Eastern Europe, the Middle East (Arabian Spring), and Asia, as well as an analysis of the potential of humankind to manage a great transition to the new sustainability paradigm. Subsequent chapters highlight the role of culture and education and review the role of different players for the implementation of the new sustainability paradigm. The focus of Part II is on the ecological pillar of Sustainability. The discussion includes urgent ecological problems including climate engineering, eco-criminality, bioterrorism, biodiversity protection, water, energy, and food security. Part III deals with needed innovations in sustainable waste management and sustainable city architecture, especially big cities in developing and threshold countries, where a significant part of the world population is concentrated. The fourth and final section offers an analysis of insights developed throughout the book, and outlines recommendations for the implementation of the New Sustainability Paradigm by civil society, grass-root movements, scholars, politically neutral NGOs, sincere media players, and by open-minded and enlightened politicians to manage and steer the Great Transition towards sustainable global democracy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Urban sprawl and associated land use changes have been referred as primary drivers of environmental change. Yet it is unclear in detail how land use changes impact vegetative structures or ecosystem services and what the specific drivers of change are, especially in urban-rural interfaces in medium-sized Chinese cities. Our future contribution is intended to highlight the importance of urban-rural interfaces for sustainable land use and the development of ecosystem services. To this end, we mapped the dynamics of land cover and the condition of vegetation as well as ecosystem services based on remote sensing data for the period of 1992–2020, to quantify these changes in Huangyan district, Taizhou, China. The results show a dramatic increase in urban area over the 28-year timeframe, i.e. 265% growth in Huangyan district. This rise was particularly evident in the period of 2015–2020. The huge expansion in urban area came at the cost of arable land. To compensate the resulting loss of farmland, large-scale natural ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and wetlands were continuously transformed into arable (as well as urbanized) land. Despite the dramatic reduction in green space as a result of urbanisation, we found a slight increase in the overall mean NDVI value for Huangyan, mainly due to the improved condition and density of remaining forest area in the western countryside. Further, we evaluated the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) by adapting an existing assessment methodology elaborated by Burkhard et al. (2012). The results show that ESS supply continually fell in Huangyan since 1992, reflecting a reduction of green space. The highest ecosystem capacity is seen in recreation and biodiversity due to the large proportion of forested area. Our findings serve as an important basis for further investigations in the region of Huangyan by framing the general issue of green space dynamics and highlighting specific developments of ecosystem distribution and change as well as ESS supply. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Humans have transformed much of Earth's land surface, giving rise to loss of biodiversity, climate change, and a host of other environmental issues that are affecting human and biophysical systems in unexpected ways. To confront these problems, environmental managers must consider human and landscape systems in integrated ways. This means making use of data obtained from a broad range of methods (e.g., sensors, surveys), while taking into account new findings from the social and biophysical science literatures. New integrative methods (including data fusion, simulation modeling, and participatory approaches) have emerged in recent years to address these challenges, and to allow analysts to provide information that links qualitative and quantitative elements for policymakers. This paper brings attention to these emergent tools while providing an overview of the tools currently in use for analysis of human-landscape interactions. Analysts are now faced with a staggering array of approaches in the human-landscape literature - in an attempt to bring increased clarity to the field, we identify the relative strengths of each tool, and provide guidance to analysts on the areas to which each tool is best applied. We discuss four broad categories of tools: statistical methods (including survival analysis, multi-level modeling, and Bayesian approaches), GIS and spatial analysis methods, simulation approaches (including cellular automata, agent-based modeling, and participatory modeling), and mixed-method techniques (such as alternative futures modeling and integrated assessment). For each tool, we offer an example from the literature of its application in human-landscape research. Among these tools, participatory approaches are gaining prominence for analysts to make the broadest possible array of information available to researchers, environmental managers, and policymakers. Further development of new approaches of data fusion and integration across sites or disciplines pose an important challenge for future work in integrating human and landscape components. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {[Purpose/Significance] The agricultural cultural heritage embodies the traditional farming wisdom, unique natural scenery and rich biodiversity formed through hundreds and thousands of years of inheritance. The study of digital technology-enabled development and utilization of agricultural cultural heritage is conducive to fully exploring the modern value of agricultural cultural heritage, strengthening the integrated interaction with the key work of rural revitalization, such as the development of modern agriculture, the construction of beautiful countryside, the construction of ecological civilization, and the entrepreneurship and innovation of farmers. On top of that, it is beneficial to the sustainable development of agricultural cultural heritage and is related to the successful implementation of the rural revitalization strategy. [Method/Process] By using the methods of literature analysis, case study and field survey, the current status and problems of agricultural cultural heritage are comprehensively reviewed. There are some problems, such as insufficient application of innovation in agricultural cultural heritage areas and inadequate value exploration. In this regard, the article puts forward several measures for the development and utilization of agricultural cultural heritage resources enabled by digital technologies after the analysis of digital management of agricultural cultural heritage resources, including building public brands in agricultural cultural heritage areas to form industrial clusters. This article takes "Anhua Black Tea" as an example to analyze the brand digital marketing mechanism and takes Li Ziqi's short videos as another example to analyze how to attract e-commerce traffic and realize traffic in the new media era and build a local brand with local characteristics with the help of "Internet plus Agriculture." It provides ideas and solutions for the development and utilization of digital technology-enabled agricultural cultural heritage. [Results/Conclusions] With the transformation of social economy, the traditional production mode of agricultural cultural heritage can no longer meet the needs of modern society. In order to make agricultural cultural heritage continue to "live", it is necessary to explore its multiple values, enable the modernization transformation of agricultural cultural heritage with the help of digital technology, realize its living state inheritance, improve the comprehensive benefits of agricultural cultural heritage and maintain sustainable development. The study explores the digital development, open communication, new scene construction and innovative utilization of agricultural cultural heritage, which can be realized through the Internet and digital technologies. Agricultural cultural heritage has many characteristics, such as brand differentiation, brand subdivision, and precise description of natural scenery, high-quality agricultural products and cultural connotation of agricultural cultural heritage. With the help of new media marketing, the ecological advantages and industrial value of agricultural cultural heritage system are explored to maximize the value of resources. A limitation of this study is that there still lacks quantitative analysis. Future research will use structural equation model and other tools to analyze the factors that affect the conversion rate of agricultural account traffic from multiple aspects such as video content, audience and platforms. © 2022 Institute of Cultural Heritage of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.

Thus the necessity for increasing the resource efficiency, minimizing both harmful greenhouse gas emissions and waste material, to transform the actual circular economy to a green economy with waste near to zero. The transition to a green economy could reduce the risks of global climate changes and ameliorate the energy security, because of its capacity to use in a better way both natural resources and waste materials. The annual cost in natural capital degradation, in fact, is estimated at US$ 7.3 trillion, almost six time the cost of greening the economy, while ∼2 billion tons of wasted food is produced on the planet together with 50 million tons of electrical waste. Therefore, the necessity to change our way of living is a must of our society. Among the use of industrial by-products, a major use of raw materials, as chitin nanofibrils obtained from crustaceans waste, will certainly contribute to accelerate the passage from a circular economy to a green economy, safeguarding the planet biodiversity also. Data and examples of this use will be reported.},

	abstract = {Identifying the impacts of anthropogenic fires on biodiversity is imperative for human-influenced tropical rainforests because: i) these ecosystems have been transformed by human-induced fires for millennia; and ii) their effective management is essential for protecting the world's terrestrial biodiversity in the face of global environmental change. While several short-term studies elucidate the impacts of fires on local plant diversity, how plant diversity responds to fire regimes over long timescales (>100 years) is a significant knowledge gap, posing substantial impediment to evidence-based management of tropical social-ecological systems. Using wet evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India as a model system, we discuss the synergistic effects of anthropogenic fires and enhanced aridity on tropical plant diversity over the past 4000 years by examining fossil pollen-based diversity indices (e.g., pollen richness and evenness, and temporal β-diversity), past fire management, the intervals of enhanced aridity due to reduced monsoon rainfall and land use history. By developing a historical perspective, our aim is to provide region-specific management information for biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. We observe that the agroforestry landscape switches between periods of no fires (4000-1800 yr BP, and 1400-400 yr BP) and fires (1800-1400 yr BP, and 400-0 yr BP), with both fire periods concomitant with intervals of enhanced aridity. We find synergistic impacts of anthropogenic fires and aridity on plant diversity uneven across time, pointing towards varied land management strategies implemented by the contemporary societies. For example, during 1800–1400 yr BP, diversity reduced in conjunction with a significant decrease in the canopy cover related to sustained use of fires, possibly linked to large-scale intensification of agriculture. On the contrary, the substantially reduced fires during 400–0 yr BP may be associated with the emergence of sacred forest groves, a cultural practice supporting the maintenance of plant diversity. Overall, notwithstanding apparent changes in fires, aridity, and land use over the past 4000 years, present-day plant diversity in the Western Ghats agroforestry landscape falls within the range of historical variability. Importantly, we find a strong correlation between plant diversity and canopy cover, emphasising the crucial role of maintenance of trees in the landscape for biodiversity conservation. Systematic tree management in tropical social-ecological systems is vital for livelihoods of billions of people, who depend on forested landscapes. In this context, we argue that agroforestry landscapes can deliver win-win solutions for biodiversity as well as people in the Western Ghats and wet tropics at large. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As one of the world’s largest and most bio-diverse countries, India’s approach to environmental policy will be very significant in tackling global environmental challenges. This book explores the transformations that have taken place in the making of environmental policy in India since the economic liberalization of the 1990s. It investigates if there has been a slow shift from top-down planning to increasingly bottom up and participatory policy processes, examining the successes and failures of recent environmental policies. Linking deliberation to collective action, this book contends that it is crucial to involve local actors in framing the policies that decide on their rights and control over bio-resources in order to achieve the goal of sustainable human development. The first examples of large-scale participatory processes in Indian environmental policy were the 1999 National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan and the 2006 Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act. This book explores these landmark policies, exploring the strategies of advocacy and deliberation that led to both the successes and failures of recent initiatives. It concludes that in order to deliberate with the state, civil society actors must engage in forms of strategic advocacy with the power to push agendas that challenge mainstream development discourses. The lessons learnt from the Indian experience will not only have immediate significance for the future of policy making in India, but they will also be of interest for other countries faced with the challenges of integrating livelihood and sustainability concerns into the governance process. © 2016 Sunayana Ganguly.},

	abstract = {Decisions regarding forest typology, management and protection are often based on the structures of present-day forests, ignoring their successional history. Forests growing on kames, eskers and various moraine hillocks common in regions with Holocene glaciation are good examples of this approach. In Estonia, these forests locally persist as fragments of continuous primary forest, but usually they are situated on former slash-and-burn areas (bushlands) or reforested agricultural land. Our aim was to elucidate the strength of the effect of long-term land-use history on the present-day vegetation compositions of mature hillock forests and their soil chemistry. It appeared that even the mature secondary hillock forests are still distinct from historically continuous stands in terms of species composition. We discovered connections between stand history and species content in hillock forests as well as transformed soil properties. The carbon and nitrogen contents in the humus horizons of secondary forests are lower while their carbon-nitrogen ratios are higher than in continuous forests. The relationship between vegetation and stand history is demonstrated by the higher proportions of anthropophytic and apophytic species in the herb layer of the secondary forests. The presence of species that are tolerant of anthropogenic impact on the secondary hillock forests floor can also be partly explained by the effect of different species in the tree and shrub layers, gaps in the tree canopy, and the boundary effect caused by the small areas of forest patches, neighboring grasslands or fields. The extinction debt in secondary communities should also be considered. © 2011 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.},

	abstract = {To meet the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals and the European Union (EU) strategy for a non-toxic environment, water resources and ecosystems management require cost-efficient solutions for prevailing complex contamination and multiple stressor exposures. For the protection of water resources under global change conditions, specific research needs for prediction, monitoring, assessment and abatement of multiple stressors emerge with respect to maintaining human needs, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Collaborative European research seems an ideal instrument to mobilize the required transdisciplinary scientific support and tackle the large-scale dimension and develop options required for implementation of European policies. Calls for research on minimizing society’s chemical footprints in the water–food–energy–security nexus are required. European research should be complemented with targeted national scientific funding to address specific transformation pathways and support the evaluation, demonstration and implementation of novel approaches on regional scales. The foreseeable pressure developments due to demographic, economic and climate changes require solution-oriented thinking, focusing on the assessment of sustainable abatement options and transformation pathways rather than on status evaluation. Stakeholder involvement is a key success factor in collaborative projects as it allows capturing added value, to address other levels of complexity, and find smarter solutions by synthesizing scientific evidence, integrating governance issues, and addressing transition pathways. This increases the chances of closing the value chain by implementing novel solutions. For the water quality topic, the interacting European collaborative projects SOLUTIONS, MARS and GLOBAQUA and the NORMAN network provide best practice examples for successful applied collaborative research including multi-stakeholder involvement. They provided innovative conceptual, modelling and instrumental options for future monitoring and management of chemical mixtures and multiple stressors in European water resources. Advancement of EU water framework directive-related policies has therefore become an option. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Recently, it has also been applied in urbanized and industrialized societies, in particular for the planning and management of urban green infrastructure (UGI).

In this paper, we discuss not only how the BCD approach could strengthen studies on human–nature interactions in an urban context, but also the potential pitfalls of applying BCD. By means of two examples of BCD research, that is people in-places and people-making UGI in cities, we argue that BCD as a reflexive concept can strengthen UGI planning and management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We have studied this phenomenon from an abstract point of view by considering artificial organisms that metabolize binary strings from a shared environment. The organisms are represented as simple cellular automaton rules and the analog of energy in the system is an approximation of the Shannon entropy of the binary strings. Only organisms that increase the entropy of the transformed strings are allowed to replicate. This system exhibits a large degree of species diversity, which increases when the flow of binary strings into the system is reduced. Investigating the relation between ecosystem productivity and diversity we find that diversity is negatively correlated with biomass production and energy uptake, while it correlates positively with energy-uptake efficiency. By performing invasion experiments, we show that the source of diversity is negative frequency-dependent selection acting among the different species, and that some of these interactions are intransitive, another mechanism known to promote diversity. © 2010 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The Greek word nomos is usually taken to mean a law or a convention governing human conduct. The concept has been developed to understand social and economic order comprising three aspects: appropriation, production and distribution. In the present paper, I focus on appropriation and define it as the knowledge claims being made and circulated in science-policy-society interactions. Three general rationales are identified: the linear (speaking truth to power), the co-production of knowledge (making sense together) and the post-truth (inventing facts for friends). The objective of the present paper is to examine how the environmental coalition has attempted to ease the problems of climate change and biodiversity loss and how the economic coalition has responded to these strategies as well as how both coalitions have used the three science-policy-society rationales. I will identify and discuss five game-theory inspired strategies that the environmental coalition has used as well as outline some examples on how the economic coalition has responded to the knowledge claims by the environmental coalition. The knowledge claims are not static but rather evolve dynamically in interactions between competing coalitions. This highlights the relevance of the recent idea that actors working at the science-policy-society nexus need to consider their opponents and tailor their knowledge claims not only based on science or on their own objectives but also in a way that counters and anticipates the opposite coalition's knowledge claims and decisions. Based on the analysis, I propose that the interactions between environmental and economic coalitions can be understood as a “Contested Emergency”. This paper highlights the relevance of knowledge claims in shaping the complex landscape of environmental governance and the challenges for movement towards a post-fossil future. The knowledge claims regarding the contested emergency end up grounding certain visions of future spatial orders and imply fundamentally different possible nomoi ranging from sustaining the status quo build on economic growth through technological solutions to radical transformative measures seeking to avoid social-ecological collapse. © 2020 Geographical Society of Northern Finland.

A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity-the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world. This record has implications for ecological and evolutionary research, conservation strategies, and the maintenance of ecosystem services, pointing to a significant need for broader cross-disciplinary engagement between archaeology and the biological and environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {Various land management strategies are used to prevent land degradation and keep land productive. Often land management strategies applied in certain areas focus on the context of the physical environment but are incompatible with the social environment where they are applied. As a result, such strategies are ignored by land users and land degradation becomes difficult to control. This study observes the impacts of land management in the upland watersheds of the Uporoto Mountains in South West Tanzania. In spite of various land management practices used in the area, 38% of the studied area experienced soil fertility loss, 30% gully erosion, 23% soil loss, 6% biodiversity loss and drying up of river sources. Land management methods that were accepted and adopted were those contributing to immediate livelihood needs. These methods did not control land resource degradation, but increased crop output per unit of land and required little labour. Effective methods of controlling land degradation were abandoned or ignored because they did not satisfy immediate livelihood needs. This paper concludes that Integrating poor people's needs would transform non-livelihood-based land management methods to livelihood-based ones. Different ways of transforming these land management methods are presented and discussed. © 2010 The Author(s). Journal compilation © 2010 The Royal Geographical Society.},

Urban and peri-urban agriculture can be considered one of such solutions contributing to urban resilience, ecosystem services and quality of life in cities. In order to upscale urban food supply and its related benefits, the concept of edible cities (referring to the use of public urban green spaces for the cost-free provision of food) gains importance in research and urban planning. This chapter presents the German frontrunner Andernach, one of the first edible cities in Germany to help understand the implementation of edible cities and their potential benefits. Interviews with major initiators of the concept showed that the edible city stands out for its multifunctional social, ecological and economic benefits addressing various urban challenges such as food security, biodiversity or social cohesion. The edible city of Andernach was implemented by the city government without a concept but by practical learning and driven by the demand to re-connect urban residents to nature and food. However, further efforts are needed that edible cities are not only “nice to have” but that urban food supply becomes a fixed task for city administration and urban policy. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Non-Technical summary. Our current global food system - from food production to consumption, including manufacture, packaging, transport, retail and associated businesses - is responsible for extensive negative social and environmental impacts which threaten the long-Term well-being of society. This has led to increasing calls from science-policy organizations for major reform and transformation of the global food system. However, our knowledge regarding food system transformations is fragmented and this is hindering the development of co-ordinated solutions. Here, we collate recent research across several academic disciplines and sectors in order to better understand the mechanisms that 'lock-in' food systems in unsustainable states. Technical summary. The current configuration of our global food system is undermining many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), leading to calls for major food system reform and transformation. Concurrently, other science-policy and business initiatives call for a food system more resilient to economic and environmental shocks, for example, by improving the economic resilience of current supply chains. Prioritization of short-Term security to a subset of vested interests, however, can undermine the resilience of longer term beneficial outcomes for society. Here we advocate a more inclusive and farsighted approach focussing on the resilience of positive outcomes for the whole of society, that is, capturing the aim to promote resilient delivery of multiple UN SDGs. A significant challenge is to prioritize suites of interventions that can effectively transform the global food system to deliver these goals. Here, we use a transdisciplinary lens to identify 'lock-in' mechanisms that span four key areas - knowledge-based, economic/regulatory, sociocultural and biophysical constraints - which will help avoid ineffective siloed solutions to food system reform. Furthermore, we show how emergent system dynamics need to be considered using a more holistic approach. We highlight the importance of well-coordinated actions on multiple leverage points during windows of opportunity for food system transformation. © The Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {In the last decades of the 20th century, the Alpine areas have witnessed a remarkable process of depopulation: The effects on the environment caused by the abandonment of agro-pastoral practices have extended beyond the local scale, changing the characteristics of the landscape and cultural traditions and transforming these areas into marginal lands. For some years now, however, there have been a number of projects throughout the Alps that are attempting to reintroduce different types of historically documented crops: For example, rye, a mountain cereal par excellence which, although not native to the Alps, was essential for food and everyday life until the 1950s. Its recovery, which is at once economic, cultural and touristic, plays a significant-and, in my opinion, fortifying-role in interaction, cooperation and exchanges between local communities and acts as a link between tradition and the present day. This example will be useful to show that the reintroduction of local and historically documented crops, if it revitalises the regional economy and at the same time protects the environment, will allow us to emphasise that investigating the Alpine space through the implementation of models of cultural and economic sustainability, emphasising the relational network and strengthening integration and behaviour through knowledge-learning-remembering, involves local communities in a more active role in society. © 2021, University of Palermo - Department of Culture and Societies.

	abstract = {Climate change, population growth and increased consumption, coupled with urbanization, are all placing increased pressure on water management. This global challenge can often best be addressed at the local level, e. g. in cities by optimizing the role of civil society. Although there are approaches for assessing the sustainability of countries and cities, there is no dedicated framework for the assessment of the sustainability of urban water management. We have therefore compiled a comprehensive list of indicators (the city blueprint) for this. The city blueprint is proposed as a first step towards gaining a better understanding and addressing the challenges of integrated urban water management (IUWM). City blueprints will enable the IUWM of cities to be compared, and stimulate the exchange of success stories (good practices) between cities to address the enormous IUWM challenges which lie ahead. The city blueprint provides a quick scan and baseline assessment. It comprises elements from a variety of methodologies, such as water footprint, urban metabolism and ecosystem services. The indicators have been subdivided into eight broad categories, i. e. (1) water security following the water footprint approach developed by Hoekstra and Chapagain (2007), (2) water quality, which includes surface water and groundwater, (3) drinking water, (4) sanitation, (5) infrastructure, (6) climate robustness, (7) biodiversity and attractiveness and (8) governance. Experience using city blueprints for the cities of Rotterdam, Maastricht and Venlo (in the Netherlands) have been included as practical examples. It was concluded that simplicity (ease of calculation and data availability), transparency and ease of communication makes the blueprint a valuable tool for policy makers, decision makers and resource managers as a first step in the process of understanding, envisioning, developing and implementing measures to transform the water management of cities. The best results are obtained when all the stakeholders are involved and connected right from the start. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {1. Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2. Here, we review questions that can be addressed using bioacoustic approaches, by providing a primer on technologies and approaches used to study animals at multiple organizational levels by ecologists, behaviourists and conservation biologists. 3. Spatially dispersed groups of microphones (arrays) enable users to study signal directionality on a small scale or to locate animals and track their movements on a larger scale. 4. Advances in algorithm development can allow users to discriminate among species, sexes, age groups and individuals. 5. With such technology, users can remotely and non-invasively survey populations, describe the soundscape, quantify anthropogenic noise, study species interactions, gain new insights into the social dynamics of sound-producing animals and track the effects of factors such as climate change and habitat fragmentation on phenology and biodiversity. 6. There remain many challenges in the use of acoustic monitoring, including the difficulties in performing signal recognition across taxa. The bioacoustics community should focus on developing a common framework for signal recognition that allows for various species' data to be analysed by any recognition system supporting a set of common standards. 7. Synthesis and applications. Microphone arrays are increasingly used to remotely monitor acoustically active animals. We provide examples from a variety of taxa where acoustic arrays have been used for ecological, behavioural and conservation studies. We discuss the technologies used, the methodologies for automating signal recognition and some of the remaining challenges. We also make recommendations for using this technology to aid in wildlife management. © 2011 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2011 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Opening up knowledge–action systems to a wider range of disciplinary and societal actors is considered to be a necessary step in achieving transformative change for sustainability. In science for sustainability, there is a growing body of experience and literature of putting this ‘co-production’ into action. However, there is an opportunity to strengthen the application of analytical resources for more explicitly recognising and accounting for the power relations embedded in these initiatives. This paper deploys social theory from science and technology studies to develop an approach to perceive power relations between the participants, processes and products of co-production. This necessitates paying attention to the multiple and distributed organisational spaces where co-production takes place to discern: who participates; who (and what) is represented; how deliberations are structured; and how outcomes are circulated. This paper shows that these organisational dimensions of participation, representation, deliberation, and circulation not only give structure to co-productive forums, but can also define the power relations between their participants, processes and products. The paper then illustrates the applicability of this approach using the case of a current global expert process for biodiversity: The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This case study offers insights on the challenges and opportunities for designing and evaluating co-production initiatives for sustainability. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Because antibiotics are explicitly designed to target microorganisms, they likely affect microbes in the soil ecosystem, compromising important soil functions and disturbing processes in nutrient cycles. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the impact of sulfadiazine-contaminated pig manure on functional microbial communities involved in key processes of the nitrogen cycle in the rootrhizosphere complexes (RRCs) of maize (Zea mays) and clover (Trifolium alexandrinum). At both the gene and transcript level, we performed real-time PCR using nifH, amoA (in both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea), nirK, nirS, and nosZ as molecular markers for nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification. Sampling was performed 10, 20, and 30 days after the application. SDZ affected the abundance pattern of all investigated genes in the RRCs of both plant species (with stronger effects in the RRC of clover) 20 and 30 days after the addition. Surprisingly, effects on the transcript level were less pronounced, which might indicate that parts of the investigated functional groups were tolerant or resistant against SDZ or, as in the case of nifH and clover, have been protected by the nodules. © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Plants and animals have evolved ever since their appearance in a largely microbial world. Their own cells are less numerous than the microorganisms that they host and with whom they interact closely. The study of these interactions, termed microbial symbioses, has benefited from the development of new conceptual and technical tools. We are gaining an increasing understanding of the functioning, evolution and central importance of symbiosis in the biosphere. Since the origin of eukaryotic cells, microscopic organisms of our planet have integrated our very existence into their ways of life. The interaction between host and symbiont brings into question the notion of the individual and the traditional representation of the evolution of species, and the manipulation of symbioses facilitates fascinating new perspectives in biotechnology and health. Recent discoveries show that association is one of the main properties of organisms, making a more integrated view of biology necessary. Microbial Symbioses provides a deliberately "symbiocentric? outlook, to exhibit how the exploration of microbial symbioses enriches our understanding of life, and the potential future for this discipline. Offers a concise summary of the most recent discoveries in the field. Shows how symbiosis is acquiring a central role in the biology of the 21st century by transforming our understanding of living things.

	abstract = {Even when no baseline data are available, the impacts of 150 years of livestock grazing on natural grasslands can be assessed using a combined approach of grazing manipulation and regional-scale assessment of the flora. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of this method across 18 sites in the semidesert Mitchell grasslands of northeastern Australia. Fifteen-year-old exclosures (ungrazed and macropod grazed) revealed that the dominant perennial grasses in the genus Astrebla do not respond negatively to grazing disturbance typical of commercial pastoralism. Neutral, positive, intermediate, and negative responses to grazing disturbance were recorded amongst plant species with no single life-form group associated with any response type. Only one exotic species, Cenchrus ciliaris, was recorded at low frequency. The strongest negative response was from a native annual grass, Chionachne hubbardiana, an example of a species that is highly sensitive to grazing disturbance. Herbarium records revealed only scant evidence that species with a negative response to grazing have declined through the period of commercial pastoralism. A regional analysis identified 14 from a total of 433 plant species in the regional flora that may be rare and potentially threatened by grazing disturbance. However, a targeted survey precluded grazing as a cause of decline for seven of these based on low palatability and positive responses to grazing and other disturbance. Our findings suggest that livestock grazing of semidesert grasslands with a short evolutionary history of ungulate grazing has altered plant composition, but has not caused declines in the dominant perennial grasses or in species richness as predicted by the preceding literature. The biggest impact of commercial pastoralism is the spread of woody leguminous trees that can transform grassland to thorny shrubland. The conservation of plant biodiversity is largely compatible with commercial pastoralism provided these woody weeds are controlled, but reserves strategically positioned within water remote areas are necessary to protect grazing-sensitive species. This study demonstrates that a combination of experimental studies and regional surveys can be used to understand anthropogenic impacts on natural ecosystems where reference habitat is not available. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Based on a case study in Uzès (Languedoc-Roussillon region, southern France), this paper attempts to characterize the potential of truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) production, a symbolic but agriculturally marginal production, to respond to decision-makers' expectations. The multidisciplinary approach developed includes landscape analysis, social surveys, and plant inventories. Beyond the truffle growers and local decision-makers' discourses and strategies, this paper shows that truffle growing has limited implications in maintaining farmers and ensuring a sustainable development of the study area. Truffle growing reflects Uzès' society transformation, now more influenced by recent urban needs and values than by rural aspirations and traditions. However, our study brings in favorable arguments regarding the roles of truffle-growing ecosystems for biodiversity and landscape heterogeneity conservation. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {Archaea are usually minor components of a microbial community and dominated by a large and diverse bacterial population. In contrast, the SM1 Euryarchaeon dominates a sulfidic aquifer by forming subsurface biofilms that contain a very minor bacterial fraction (5%). These unique biofilms are delivered in high biomass to the spring outflow that provides an outstanding window to the subsurface. Despite previous attempts to understand its natural role, the metabolic capacities of the SM1 Euryarchaeon remain mysterious to date. In this study, we focused on the minor bacterial fraction in order to obtain insights into the ecological function of the biofilm. We link phylogenetic diversity information with the spatial distribution of chemical and metabolic compounds by combining three different state-of-the-art methods: PhyloChip G3 DNA microarray technology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy. The results of PhyloChip and FISH technologies provide evidence for selective enrichment of sulfate-reducing bacteria, which was confirmed by the detection of bacterial dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit B (dsrB) genes via quantitative PCR and sequence-based analyses. We further established a differentiation of archaeal and bacterial cells by SR-FTIR based on typical lipid and carbohydrate signatures, which demonstrated a co-localization of organic sulfate, carbonated mineral and bacterial signatures in the biofilm. All these results strongly indicate an involvement of the SM1 euryarchaeal biofilm in the global cycles of sulfur and carbon and support the hypothesis that sulfidic springs are important habitats for Earth's energy cycles. Moreover, these investigations of a bacterial minority in an Archaea-dominated environment are a remarkable example of the great power of combining highly sensitive microarrays with label-free infrared imaging. © 2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.

	abstract = {The improvement of protected areas (PAs) is a global challenge for society. In 2017, China implemented the ambitious “Ecological Conservation Redline” (ECR) program, with the aim of increasing its PA estate and improving human welfare. Since its implementation, the ECR has attracted much attention from both researchers and managers. However, the understanding of the ECR by some researchers is still unclear, resulting in debates about its practicality and effectiveness. We therefore provide a clear description of the ECR in this paper. The ECR was proposed as a conservation theory in China in 2011 and was transformed into nationwide practice in 2017. Compared with existing PAs, the ECR expanded the conservation network by considering hotspots of ecological function and fragility beyond biodiversity, which was highlighted by the example of Sichuan Province, China. To balance the demands of conservation and development, a list of “positive” human activities is presented following negotiations between government and stakeholders. In addition, a remote sensing platform and an ecological compensation system have been applied to provide technological and economic support to the ECR. Finally, we make recommendations for improving the redline identification method, evaluating the effects of its implementation, broadening the funding sources for ecological compensation, and strengthening legal safeguarding. The advancement of the ECR provides a new model for environmental planning leading to a sustainable future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Policy makers assume that people are antagonistic toward conserving crocodiles in the wild and think that the enforcement of environmental legislation in a context of widespread rural poverty is illegitimate and ineffective. They argue that these negative public attitudes can only be transformed by generating revenues for rural communities, for example, through crocodile ranching or ecotourism. Despite the evident failure to conserve crocodiles in the wild, this thinking continues to underpin policy and practice in the Philippines. A community-based conservation project in the northern Sierra Madre on Luzon puts this utilitarian logic in perspective. The project succeeded in transforming hostile attitudes toward crocodiles and mobilized broad societal support for the protection of the Philippine crocodile and its freshwater habitat. Cultural values, such as pride in the occurrence of this rare and iconic species, form an important incentive for people to support the preservation of the species in the wild. These experiences highlight the importance of moving beyond ideological positions in discussions on biodiversity conservation, and enable the design of integrative and innovative solutions to conserve wildlife in human-dominated landscapes. © 2011 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {Sustainability accounting and accountability is fundamental in the pursuit of low-carbon and less unsustainable societies. Highlighting that accounting, organisations and economic systems are intertwined with sustainability, the book discusses how sustainability accounting and accountability broaden the spectrum of information used in organisational decision-making and in evaluating organisational success. The authors show how sustainability accounting can prove to be transformative, but only if critical questions are sufficiently addressed. This new and completely rewritten edition provides a comprehensive overview of sustainability accounting and accountability. Relevant global context and key concepts are outlined providing the reader with the conceptual resources to engage with the topic. Drawing on the most recent research and topical practical insights, the book discusses a wide variety of sustainability accounting and accountability topics, including management accounting and organisational decision-making, sustainability reporting frameworks and practices, as well as ESG-investments, financial markets and risk management. The book also highlights the role accounting has with key sustainability issues through dedicated chapters on climate, water, biodiversity, human rights and economic inequality. Each chapter is supplemented with practical examples and academic reading lists to allow in-depth engagement with the key questions. Sustainability Accounting and Accountability walks the reader through a spectrum of themes which are essential for all accountants and organisations. It helps the reader to understand why our traditional accounting techniques and systems are not sufficient for navigating the contemporary sustainability challenges our societies are facing. This key book will be an essential resource for undergraduate and postgraduate instructors and students, as an entry point to sustainability accounting and accountability, as well as being a vital book for researchers. © 2022 Matias Laine, Helen Tregidga and Jeffrey Unerman.

	abstract = {With global environmental sustainability at the crossroads, approaches are needed to build an ecologically literate culture for collective societal navigation through the intricacies of swift environmental change. This paper demonstrates a transdisciplinary approach, grounded at the intersection between the arts and sciences, to increase awareness and understanding of the current biodiversity crisis. It focuses on one aspect of biodiversity, beta diversity, which examines how sets of animal and plant species differ between habitats. Theory and real examples of beta diversity of aquatic animal and plant species from dried-out ponds in Mediterranean Spain are presented in pixelized visuals. These visuals are artistic expression of and build the prior knowledge about beta diversity, which is scrutinized subsequently with statistical analyses to support the artistic approach with an objectively identified and numerically underpinned presentation of structure in the visuals. The choice to examine beta diversity in theory and reality first through art and then through science is deliberate. Combined, these aspects examine biodiversity through an eco-centric, rather than a species- and habitat centric view, incorporate elements of surprise (how can aquatic species in dry ecosystems survive), and reduce uncertainty (by providing a common numerical yardstick for interpreting the visuals). Together they can optimize a goal-directed learning process in the viewers necessary for making judgments, inducing affective reactions, and facilitating memory and decision making. The approach presented here provides an integral qualitative and quantitative model useful for a broader inductive-deductive education process towards finding sustainable solutions as our planet moves swiftly to a future without historical analogue. Combined art-sciences approaches, as the one presented here, are useful to facilitate citizens’ comprehension of the scientific and potential policy dimensions of environmental change, including biodiversity problems, especially because it is the general public that bears the costs of transformation and adaptation measures. © 2016, The Author(s).},

In this context, a course dealing with intercultural communication and sustainable leadership that is part of a M.Sc. programme on ICT in Education for Sustainable Development has been developed and is studied in this chapter. The course puts emphasis on the most urgent and critical social, environmental, and economic challenges facing the world and explores how leaders from education, business, government and civil society are responding to global/local sustainability challenges. In particular, it elaborates on the nature of sustainability leadership and how it can contribute to transformational change. It does this by locating sustainability within the leadership literature and presenting a model of sustainability leadership that integrates three complementary types of leadership, namely: distributed; entrepreneurial and transformational. The course also examines the importance of sustainable leadership practices within organisations (e.g. schools, business, NGOs, public) and assess the potential benefits if institutions are more actively engaged in sustainable leadership practices. It explores how intercultural communication can contribute to positive change for sustainability and discusses that new theoretical frameworks are needed to better understand effective transformational leadership. It also elaborates how cultural orientations and intercultural communication competence affect the full range leadership framework and transformational leadership dimensions.

	abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, biodiversity was not a central concern of biologists or ecosystems theorists (Tilman 2000). Nonetheless, a significant number of books and papers by biologists and philosophers were sounding a warning about the loss of species, the possible impact of such losses on ecosystem functions and the reduction in value – both moral and economic – that was likely as a consequence of the reduction in natural variety (Norton 1986, 1987; E. O. Wilson 1992). These writers emphasized that biodiversity encompassed a number of different levels. In E. O. Wilson’s view, there were at least three different levels of natural variety that were worth preserving: first, the variety of alleles (gene variants within individuals); second, the variety of species themselves; and finally, the range of varied ecosystems found across the surface of the planet and within its caverns, rivers, lakes and oceans. In his 1987 book, Bryan G. Norton emphasized a number of features that have since come to prominence in writing on biodiversity. First, a case – but not necessarily a strong one – for preserving the current variety of species can be built on the utility they have – whether actually or potentially – for human beings, rather than because of any deeper value they may have in their own right. If the value of systems, plants and animals is viewed solely in terms of what economists call “demand values” – those features for which we have preferences in light of the pleasure, utility and other benefits and services they provide to us – then the value of biodiversity is in theory measurable by various techniques (such as surveys of consumer preferences, willingness to pay to protect areas of diversity, estimating the expenditures people make to visit areas of biodiversity, and so on). Given our limited knowledge, such attributed economic values may well underestimate the full economic value of many species, and any noneconomic values they may have (Sagoff 1988, O’Neill et al. 2008). Second, Norton argued that the best way to preserve natural variety was through preserva-tion of habitats. Unlike this relatively uncontroversial point, a third component of his argument was, and remains, more controversial. Norton claimed that by leaving wild nature alone and encouraging humans to have appropriate interactions with natural species, there was a prospect for a transformation of values: “experiences of wild species have value because they play a positive role in transforming less acceptable into more acceptable values” (Norton 1987: 237). Such transformation would affect not only the individual preferences a person has, but even the person’s ordering among such preferences. Some might argue that in the twenty-five years sincethe publication of Norton’s work, values have already undergone some level of transformation, as evidenced by the fact that concern for biodiversity, wilderness places, and for ecosystem health, flourishing and prosperity is now much more widespread than it was and is, at least nominally, a central plank of much government and corporate planning and policy worldwide. Further, the rising popularity of rewilding movements testifies to the idea that experiences of wild nature may be able to transform values and develop our characters in a multitude of ways (C. Fraser 2009, Monbiot 2013). One factor in the emergence of the greater interest in biodiversity was probably the con-silience between the work of scientists and philosophers just mentioned, and the publication in 1992 of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. This document was finalized in May 1992, in time to be launched at the Rio Summit in June of that year, and finally brought into force in December 1993 (Convention on Biological Diversity 1992). The preamble to the document refers explicitly both to the utility of nature, and also to its intrinsic value. The contracting parties, it explains, are conscious “of the intrinsic value of biological diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values of biological diversity and its components”. They are also “conscious of the importance of biological diversity for evolution and for maintaining life sustaining systems of the biosphere” (1). The convention has set the context for a range of initiatives associated both with protectingbiodiversity for its own sake, and also seeking to ensure that the components of biodiversity are used in a sustainable way. The involvement of biological scientists with national and international policy-making has been aided by the emergence of conservation biology as an academic field of study focusing on the preservation of biodiversity. As a result, reports on the state of the planet’s biodiversity are now a central feature of science inputs to policy at high levels and of reporting in the leading science journals (see for example Butchart et al. 2010). A further central ambition of the convention was that the benefits arising from use of theplanet’s genetic resources should be shared equitably and fairly across the globe. Such initiatives and ambitions are also endorsed by the independently sponsored Earth Charter, launched in June 2000, the first principle of which calls for respect for life in all its diversity. Like the convention, the charter also calls for social justice to be combined with care for biodiversity and natural processes, thus aiming simultaneously to protect the intrinsic values of nature and diversity, and also ensure that environmental goods and services are made available to all without bias or discrimination (Earth Charter Commission 2000). As a civil society initiative, the charter has been endorsed by thousands of individuals and organizations, including UNESCO. By contrast, the biodiversity convention is for ratification by states and federations of states, such as the European Union. Two notable abstentions from ratification of the convention to date are the USA and the Holy See. Some have seen both the convention and the charter as documents whose aspirations anddemands are best located within a universal or global ethic, hence providing philosophers and other ethical theorists the opportunity to explore the prospects for global ethics. Since both documents recognize the value of human cultural, linguistic and social diversity, their appeal to a universal convergence of values is not meant to suggest that one ethic will be appropriate for everyone everywhere (Dower 2005). Rather, the documents can be seen as embodying values that are shared by different individuals, groups and nation states, independent of the variety of different social, ethical and religious perspectives that characterize their underlying worldviews. But what shared values might these be? There are clearly many goods derived from nature ranging from the pleasure and excitement derived from studies of various parts of nature and communicated through nature documentaries all the way through to the extraction andconversion of natural resources for human benefit. One key idea that can unite different perspectives on natural values is based on an appeal to preserving future opportunities for the enjoyment of such goods. As Norton has put it, very different human groups, with widely varying perspectives, can perhaps “accept responsibility to maintain a non-declining set of opportunities based on possible uses of the environment”. The preservation of options for the future can be readily linked to notions of equity in the way we approach sustainability so that “the future ought not to face, as a result of our actions today, a seriously reduced range of options and choices, as they try to adapt to the environment that they face” (Norton 2002: 419). A further reason for thinking of biodiversity in global rather than national or regional terms isthat species loss is often caused by, and will in turn affect, different groups of people and different nations in a multitude of different but interconnected ways. Both the causes and the results of species loss are dispersed in space and in time. Climate change that leads to species loss is a good example of such dispersal. Once greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they can have effects geographically far away from their source. Since the gases persist for many hundreds of years in the atmosphere, they also have effects remote in time from when they were produced (Gardiner 2011). Moreover, since rich people, with the highest consumption patterns, are themselves dispersed over many different countries, per capita responsibility for CO2 emissions is not evenly correlated with the relative affluence of particular countries. In nation states with high levels of social and economic inequality and low levels of social welfare, the effects of ecosystem degradation and species loss caused by climate change are likely to have the highest impact on those who are less well off. In consequence, just as the preservation of nature and natural systems poses a global problem, so do questions about mitigation and justice for individuals and communities affected by environmental decline (Jamieson 2010). © 2015 Darrel Moellendorf and Heather Widdows, selection and editorial matter; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Linking deliberation to collective action, this book contends that it is crucial to involve local actors in framing the policies that decide on their rights and control over bio-resources in order to achieve the goal of sustainable human development. The first examples of large-scale participatory processes in Indian environmental policy were the 1999 National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan and the 2006 Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act. This book explores these landmark policies, exploring the strategies of advocacy and deliberation that led to both the successes and failures of recent initiatives. It concludes that in order to deliberate with the state, civil society actors must engage in forms of strategic advocacy with the power to push agendas that challenge mainstream development discourses. The lessons learnt from the Indian experience will not only have immediate significance for the future of policy making in India, but they will also be of interest for other countries faced with the challenges of integrating livelihood and sustainability concerns into the governance process. © 2016 Sunayana Ganguly.},

Building on a previous study synthesizing the results from monitoring efforts of the island’s coastline from 1977 to 2018, we offer a joint analysis of scientific and local perceptions of coastal changes and of the impacts of coastal armoring in Moorea. Drawing on ecological and ethnographic data (111 semi-structured interviews of Moorea residents and representatives from local authorities), we analyze the drivers invoked by near-shore residents to modify their coastline as well as the perceived effects of coastal artificialization on the near-shore marine biodiversity and topography. We also address the broader economic and political contexts under which the island’s coastline is being increasingly transformed. Overall, our study highlights how the perceptions of increased erosion coupled to poorly enforced regulations drive the progressive armoring of the coastline through a diversity of private-based developments. We discuss how the latter have, both for scientists and residents, controversial community-wide economic, social, and ecological impacts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The ancient, pre-human landscape of Europe was most likely a treed (or wooded) landscape, for which ‘some key words are open-grown trees, wood-pasture, scrub, and with a major driver, grazing and browsing animals’ (Green, 2013, p128). A number of other important natural phenomena have shaped the structure of such landscapes, including fire, tree diseases, soil maturation, soil humidity, and interactions between species including predators and herbivores (summarized in Vera, 2000 and see the articles from a special issue from British Wildlife, 2009). After the human colonization of Europe, however, human agency and natural factors closely interacted in the creation, dynamic and maintenance of treed landscapes while recently the disappearance of many valuable treed landscapes of Europe is almost exclusively related to humans. Therefore, the social and ecological processes around treed landscapes in a human-shaped Europe cannot be separated. There is a large variety of understandings of what actually defines wood- pastures. An important criterion is that such lands are regularly grazed by natural large grazers or by domestic livestock or both. Frequently used terms that partly overlap with ‘wood-pasture’ and are often used synonymously are ‘ancient park’, ‘primeval savannah’, ‘Central European savannah’, ‘pasture woodland’, ‘semi-open pastureland’, ‘traditional orchard’, ‘woodland pasture’, ‘wooded pasture’, ‘wooded meadow’, ‘pastoral woodland’ and ‘silvopastoral system’ (or the broader ‘agroforestry system’, which includes crop production as well). In its broadest sense, wood-pastures are treed landscapes, with grazing (by large mammals) being the most important driver. Bergmeier et al. (2010) enumerate 13 terms used to name wood-pastures in Europe, based on regional (including informal) names and on a geobotanical classification. This diversity of terms and expressions likely reflects the structural diversity of wood-pastures in different regions of Europe and also the personal experiences of those persons who study or manage them. Wood-pastures have a wide diversity of physiognomies across Europe, and site profiles from various countries that appear throughout this book reflect this variety. This diversity of terms and the regional distinction that they display is certainly useful, and it is not our intention to make any bold suggestion in favour of one or other term, or to generate discussions about the validity of one or other term. Rather, we try to identify the features that many of these landscape have in common across different social and ecological settings in Europe. We use ‘wood-pasture’ as a unifying term because we believe that it is the most widely used concept and that all current regional expressions of lands that include trees and (livestock) grazing can be assembled under its umbrella. The name attributed to grazed treed landscapes is indeed very important from the perspective of understanding, management and conservation, for example, it is difficult to provide protective status for something that has no name. Mislabelling such treed landscapes is equally problematic; if we call a wood-pasture ‘pasture’, the general tendency will be to manage these lands primarily as pastures and to ignore the woody component. However, if a wood-pasture is valued for its wood component while the pasture component (i.e. management with grazing) is ignored, it will transform into a closed forest where the grazing is prohibited and declared illegal activity, as indeed happens with most European forests managed by modern forestry. Most of the current wood-pastures of Europe had a period of (traditional) multifunctional management in their history (i.e. when they were truly ‘working wood-pastures’). This multifunctional management historically was driven by local needs and possibilities and typically involved livestock grazing but also the use of a number of goods and services provided by the shrubs and woody vegetation (the products from coppicing and pollarding being examples of the latter). Recognition of the biodiversity and ecological value of the wood-pastures is only very recent, but is increasingly seen as an important modern-day service: the number of protected species is potentially high in wood-pastures (Bergmeier et al., 2010) and they have keystone structures like the large, old trees (Lindenmayer et al., 2013) that support a high level of biodiversity at local and landscape scale. Moreover, wood-pastures can contribute to landscape connectivity, ecological memory and adaptation to climate change (Manning et al., 2006, 2009). Wood-pastures are fragile ecosystems because they are intermediate between open pastures and closed-canopy forests, and they need grazing as the ecological driver for their maintenance. Thus, they are vulnerable to ‘flip’ into a scrub-and closed woodland-dominated stage if grazing and the associated maintenance activities are abandoned or significantly reduced. Wood-pasture systems persist ‘as a result of a balance between divergent ecological processes’ (Gillet, 2008: 2). However, if grazing is prohibited or significantly reduced, there is a tendency of the woody component to overgrow the pasture. This tendency exists because scattered trees and shrubs confer a high regenerative potential to the woody vegetation acting as ‘regeneration nuclei’ for them (Manning et al., 2006, 2009). By contrast, grazing (usually accompanied by other human management activities such as shrub removal) will hamper the development of a closed forest (Vera, 2000). Wood-pastures need constant management not only for their persistence but also for the provision of ecosystem goods and services that they provide to society (Bugalho et al., 2011). During the history of wood-pastures, the variation of grazing intensity or even the temporal or permanent cessation of grazing in some marginal parts of the wood-pasture was a common phenomenon. This was caused by the fluctuation of livestock number, or various shocks experienced by the communities during the history that affected the grazing process and other aspects of wood-pasture management (see for example Rotherham, 2013). These variations in grazing intensity resulted in variations in the woody vegetation and shrub cover in the wood-pastures. These structural changes can be visible even at a very small scale within a wood-pasture due to the fast growing of some tree species. Figure 1.1 illustrates the process of quick Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) regeneration in the Breite ancient wood-pasture from Transylvania (Romania) in a short time after the complete cessation of grazing. Figure 1.2 presents a generalized model of the relationship between the tree-(wood)-related and grassland-related management interventions and the vegetation structure, ecological functions and biodiversity of wood-pastures. © 2014 Tibor Hartel and Tobias Plieninger, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {It is proposed to present an ecological tourism case study in African insular context that is been pursued by a research team that the author is the coordinator. First of all, in the team, we have a PhD in African Development, specialized in ecological tourism and pursuing the Post Doctoral research, two master degrees in African tourism, a MBA and a PhD student in environmental issues.The main theoretical background is the development alternative approach complemented by the ecological tourism concept and the evaluation indicators and methods about the impacts of the practice increase in the community life and environment balance. Sao Tome e Principe is a small insular and African country in development (SIDS). It is an archipelago that is endowed with a diversified environmental patrimony where it is possible to identify and to classify different protected areas in agreement with the international indicators. Some examples are the Natural Park Obo in the two main islands (Sao Tome and Principe islands) and the Ecological Areas (Malanza and Praia das Conchas), characterized by the biodiversity and endemic flora and fauna in the forest, coastal and sea areas. The archipelago has many natural potentialities that are adapted to the ecological tourism and the observation practice. On the other hand, it is a country with abundance of natural resources that are the maintenance of the local community who are dependent of the nature to guarantee the family survival, developing traditional cultural practices, exercising and added load in the environment. In spite of the Government considered and recognized officially the importance of the ecological segment in 2000, at present in Sao Tome and Principe tourism is still a marginal sector. The participation and the local community empowerment in the ecological tourism projects with environmental preservation had been valued in the last years. Some examples are the important societies or partnerships with community groups, local associations and Non Governmental Organizations in coastal areas as well as in rural context. Because of the importance of the education in the development, concerning to make certain the local poverty relief as well as the improvement of the community abilities, the care about the environment education is real, especially when we analyse the ecological tourism experiences. In Sao Tome and Principe it is already visible the concern with the environmental education and the formation for the nature preservation and the conservation of the threatened animals in extinction. Those fragile species have a decisive importance for the ecological tourism practice but are a preferred target for the local consumption. The target groups of the education actions are both, the youth and scholar population as well as the working people like the small fisher, the fish sellers and the artisans. The research indicates that in Sao Tome and Principe something is changing slowly but it is already possible to identify some transformation signs in the local people mentality and practices.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that biodiversity is the measure of biological variety at many scales, from the gene to the ecosystem. Much attention has been given to diversity of species within forests, especially trees that are being harvested. The challenge is to see the forest for the trees: How can the idea of biodiversity at the ecosystem level be translated into practical action for better management of forest ecosystems? The definition of "ecosystem" is reasonably well agreed. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines the term as "a dynamic complex of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit". The living components of an ecosystem interact in very complex food webs (Schoener, 1989). Ecosystem approaches to forest management take into consideration the complexity of these interactions and seek both to maintain the productivity of forest ecosystems and to enhance their capacity to adapt to change. Focusing on the ecosystem level provides a strong basis for solving critical problems in resource management. For example, conserving forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level helps to support services such as maintaining the balance of atmospheric gases, recycling nutrients, regulating climate, maintaining hydrological cycles and creating soil (Daily, 1997). While scientists are still developing their understanding of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, productivity, stability and adaptability of ecosystems, new research indicates that species diversity enhances the productive capacity of many forest ecosystems and their ability to adapt to changing conditions (Johnson et al., 1996). Another important implication of considering forest biodiversity at the ecosystem level is the potential of mismanagement leading to the essentially permanent transformation of a highly productive forest into a much less productive system (such as a grassland). Recent research has indicated that even gradual changes in climate, the flow of nutrients, extraction of natural resources and habitat fragmentation can lead to sudden drastic switches in the character of a forest ecosystem (Scheffer et al., 2001). While many different factors can lead to such shifts, a critical factor is a loss of resilience (the ability to recover from external events) through declining biodiversity at the ecosystem level. In seeking to apply ecosystem approaches to forest biodiversity, especially forests that are being influenced by increasing levels of use by people, it is helpful to focus on some key questions. First, are people part of forest ecosystems? Second, what are the impacts of human harvesting on forest ecosystems? Third, how can forest ecosystems be managed so that they provide both the goods and the services that are required by modern society? This article briefly explores these key issues, and indicates appropriate lines of action to be taken in future.},

	abstract = {Facultative paedomorphosis is an environmentally induced polymorphism that results in the coexistence of mature, gilled, and fully aquatic paedomorphic adults and transformed, terrestrial, metamorphic adults in the same population. This polymorphism has been of interest to scientists for decades because it occurs in a large number of caudate amphibian taxa as well as in a large diversity of habitats. Numerous experimental and observational studies have been conducted to explain the proximate and ultimate factors affecting these heterochronic variants in natural populations. The production of each alternative phenotype is based on a genotype x environment interaction and research suggests that differences in the environment can produce paedomorphs through several ontogenetic pathways. No single advantage accounts for the maintenance of this polymorphism. Rather, the interplay of different costs and benefits explains the success of the polyphenism across variable environments. Facultative paedomorphosis allows individuals to cope with habitat variation, to take advantage of environmental heterogeneity in the presence of open niches, and to increase their fitness. This process is expected to constitute a first step towards speciation events, and is also an example of biodiversity at the intraspecific level. The facultative paedomorphosis system is thus ripe for future studies encompassing ecology, evolution, behaviour, endocrinology, physiology, and conservation biology. Few other systems have been broad enough to provide varied research opportunities on topics as diverse as phenotypic plasticity, speciation, mating behaviour, and hormonal regulation of morphology. Further research on facultative paedomorphosis will provide needed insight into these and other important questions facing biologists. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

	abstract = {Worldwide degradation of arable land, freshwater depletion and the loss of biodiversity are three of several ongoing 'global environmental changes' that endanger the biosphere's human utility - including food supplies, an essential, 'utility'. The degradation of local and regional food-producing environmental assets is a familiar story historically. Today, however, pressures and stresses on food production are becoming global in scale, reflecting (in addition to the above three) a range of large-scale human-induced environmental changes, such as global climate change and environmental nitrification. Human-induced biodiversity loss reflects land-use changes, other aspects of the over-exploitation of productive terrestrial and marine ecosystems, climate change, and the trans-boundary migration of pollutants and exotic species. Indeed, biodiversity loss has, for long, been an inevitable trade-off against the increased capacity to produce food for larger human populations - as occurs in agrarian societies when forests are replaced by crops. More recently, trade, technology, knowledge dissemination, and the worldwide transformation of ecosystems have further boosted food supplies for the increasing human population. (That this abundance often fails to improve health, for example by fuelling obesity, is another story.) Recent time-series data show an unusual, continuing, decline in per capita yields of grain, globally, since 1996. Detrimental environmental changes may be a contributory explanation, but causal attribution is complex. The links between environmental changes, food production, nutrient status and human health are similarly complex, and difficult to demonstrate epidemiologically. These environmental (particularly ecosystem) changes mostly affect the health of populations via complex, indirect pathways, and these impacts are modulated by local social-economic conditions.},

The transformation of wasalexins A and B in cultures of isolates of L. maculans, an isolate highly virulent towards canola (BJ 125) and a less common isolate which is virulent towards wasabi (Laird 2/Mayfair 2) was investigated. It was established that both fungal isolates are able to efficiently metabolize and detoxify wasalexins A and B through reduction in the case of wasalexin A or through hydrolysis followed by reduction in the case of wasalexin B. Moreover, a close structural analogue of wasalexins, which does not occur naturally, was also found to be reduced in cultures of L. maculans. The structures of the new metabolic products were elucidated using spectroscopic methods and were confirmed by synthesis. Bioassays indicated that the biotransformation of wasalexins is a detoxification process that may contribute to the aggressive nature of these fungal isolates towards plants that produce wasalexins. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.},

Activation of the proton conductance of UCP1 was synergistic: proton conductance in the presence of both palmitate and 4-HNE was significantly greater than the sum of the individual effects. Mitochondria from control yeast transformed with empty vector showed no such synergy, showing that synergy is a property of UCP1. Activation by the 4-HNE analogue trans-cinnamate showed essentially the same characteristics as activation by 4-HNE. Mitochondria from brown adipose tissue also showed synergistic activation of GDP-sensitive proton conductance by palmitate and 4-HNE.

	abstract = {The project of rethinking Southeast Asian area studies has engaged the historical emergence, logical coherence (and lack thereof), institutional structures, and conceptual orientations in scholarship on Southeast Asia. Our desire to rethink the nature of "areas" is a response to interventions from postcolonial studies, which have given us new ways to think about historical linkages, and to studies of globalization, which have provided us with new possibilities for imagining spatial interconnection. Within these reflexive conversations, scholarly collaboration (both within the region and between Southeast Asia and Euro-America) has emerged as both a problem for thought and as a remedy for hierarchies that exist between scholars "in" and scholars "of" Southeast Asia. Collaboration presents the possibility of facilitating a more egalitarian knowledge production in which Southeast Asians speak authoritatively as subjects of their own histories and are recognized for generating ideas in transnational settings. In this chapter, I examine the study of environmental politics in Southeast Asia in order to understand the pragmatics of transnational scholarly collaboration and to explore the ways in which collaboration may be a more difficult solution than it seems at first glance. Southeast Asia has experienced substantial transformation in its flora, fauna, landscapes, and marinescapes, trends that are reflected in large-scale fires; modifications of coastlines and forests; historically unprecedented levels of commodification and consumption of land and sea products; the constriction of genetic resources through green-revolution agriculture and the proliferation of genes out of place in genetically modified crops; and serious cases of pollution and toxicity in rural and urban spaces. Nature-its social construction and its biophysical transformation-has always provoked interesting questions for the study of the region. In both mainland and insular Southeast Asia there has been considerable debate over what will count as a human enhancement of the natural environment and what will be considered environmental degradation. Social studies of nature have included both the local specificities and poetics of place-based framings of nature and the larger regional, national, and international contexts of markets, policies, practices, histories, and ideologies through which nature is known and made. I base my analysis in this chapter on two and a half years of research in Southeast Asia, primarily in Indonesia, between 1994 and 2003. Between 1994 and 1997, I studied Indonesians' biodiversity conservation in the Togean Islands of Central Sulawesi, and I examined how Indonesian natural scientists made sense of transnational biodiversity discourses while their own biological science and conservation practice took on specific form. In this work I observed how the politics of nature seeped out of Indonesians' biodiversity conservation precisely because of the mandates of transnational collaboration. Between 2000 and 2003, I turned my attention to the comparative study of cultural and historical (rather than biological) approaches to nature in the region. This work involved wide-ranging discussions with Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese social scientists about scholarship and teaching in the field of society and environment. It also entailed a more narrowly focused study of the histories of Thai social science and of Indonesian intellectual movements in the post-Suharto era. In this work, I have been interested in the theories Southeast Asian scholars use to pursue studies of nature and society, in the questions these intellectuals have wanted to address, and in how they have understood the relations between culture, nature, scholarship, and political power.

	abstract = {Global warming causes heavy rainfall and rising sea levels. These climate effects prove to be a strong motivation for looking differently at issues of water management and safety in estuaries. For decades the only answer to hazardous situations (e.g. flooding by increased river discharges or by incoming storm water) was to strengthen levees and dams. This led to damage in the natural water system, a declining biodiversity and destruction of the unique estuary and river landscapes. Nowadays different approaches are more frequently implemented, creating more space for the rivers as a guiding principle. Instead of stemming and/or speeding discharge, water is contained in estuaries and/or catchment areas. This alternative approach to water management contributes to a more sustainable development of the estuary, protecting the natural and ecological values. However estuaries are often densely populated areas, accommodating several (conflicting) spatial and economic functions, such as residential areas, ports and harbors, industrial zones, farming and recreational facilities. Creating more space for water management projects (i.e. retention areas, flood planes and wash lands) leaves less space available for other spatial developments. As a consequence, stakeholders will be affected in their interests; e.g. cities cannot grow unrestrained and farming will have to be downsized. Concepts such as ‘multiple land use’ and ‘societal cost—benefit evaluation’ come to mind to characterize the challenge for transforming the designated areas into more sustainable, multi-functional retention basins. Governmental agencies are often acting as project executives in these transformations. They are faced with various stakeholders who are all trying to defend or strengthen their specific interests. A vital question is how to communicate with these stakeholders in the different stages of the transformation process. What communication strategy applies to what situation. And equally important, if a communication strategy is developed, how should it be implemented. What will the message be, how are the target groups identified and addresses, which mediums should be applied. And, more important, what kind of public participation is required to enable cooperation and avoid opposition to the transformation process. In general four basic communication strategies can be identified: co-knowing, co-thinking, co-working and co-deciding. Each of these strategies apply to different situations, following the cultural and historic context in the area, the established relationship between the ‘governor and the governed’, and of course, the preferred style of governance. In a research assignment involving four governmental agencies in The Netherlands, the UK and Belgium—the Interreg IIIB-project Flood control Management in Estuaries/FRaME1—we have evaluated the applied communication strategies in various flood control areas in the EU. For this assignment, an evaluative framework was developed. The evaluation shows the suitability of the applied communication strategy in each of the reviewed areas. Moreover, lessons are drawn on the question of which type of communication strategy is most suitable in what situation. Also, the review gives examples of good practice and inspiration for ‘sustainable’ communication efforts in future transformation processes. © 2006, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

	abstract = {Loss of biodiversity is considered by many scientists to be Australia's single greatest environmental problem. Biodiversity is a fundamental part of the natural infrastructure underpinning our society and is of immense cultural and social value. Legislative requirements and community demands mean that planning for biodiversity is increasingly becoming a significant issue for development land use planning and natural resource management. A range of existing legislative planning and policy tools exist for guiding and regulating the development process and these tools have the potential to significantly affect biodiversity. Understanding biodiversity, assessing it, and integrating it within land use planning processes is a challenging and complex task. In many cases, loss of biodiversity is irreversible. Biodiversity planning involves more than just ensuring natural ecosystems are taken into account in development projects. It requires integrating science with land use planning, ensuring appropriate investment programs and ongoing management. This paper provides an overview of why biodiversity will remain a priority for land use planning and management, what tools are available for planners and approaches that might assist planners in using these tools. It focuses on local government and development planning and argues that effective planning for biodiversity requires a more informed understanding of biodiversity by planners and changes to current planning frameworks that support development and transformation of natural ecosystems. Issues which are essential for successful planning for biodiversity are discussed, including: Developing an appropriate planning and organisational framework for integrating biodiversity with other diverse planning issues: Ensuring decision-making processes reflect relevant planning scales and phases, and use scientific information effectively; and Identifying and communicating biodiversity values for planning purposes. Proposed improvements to current planning practice include prioritising planning objectives, presenting scientific data for planning purposes, specifying biodiversity planning principles, defining relevant terms, and using the concept of ecological planning settings. Examples are drawn from current practice including the Biodiversity Planning Guide for NSW Local Government and the Planning Framework for Natural Ecosystems - NSW Southern Tablelands and ACT. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Worldwide climate change and loss of biodiversity are issues of global scope and importance that have recently become subjects of considerable public concern. Unlike classical public health issues and many environmental issues, their perceived threat lies in their potential to disrupt ecological functioning and stability rather than from any direct threat they may pose to human health. Over the last 5 years, the international scientific community and the general public have become aware of the implications that atmospheric warming might have for world climate patterns and the resulting changes in the persistence, location, and composition of ecosystems worldwide. At the same time, awareness of the magnitude of current and impending losses of the world's biological diversity has increased. Human activities are currently responsible for a species loss rate that is the most extreme in millions of years, and an alarmingly increasing rate of transformation and fragmentation of natural landscapes. We are just beginning to grasp the meaning of this loss in terms of opportunity costs to human society and the less quantifiable losses associated with simplification of natural ecosystems. In the case of both global warming and reduction of biological diversity, man is affecting nature in an unprecedented fashion, on a global scale, and with unpredictable and frequently irreversible results.},

	abstract = {The implementation of the Rio protocol and the preservation of biodiversity at the national and regional levels is an important step in achieving sustainable forestry. This is indeed a challenging task since our knowledge of the ecology and habitat demands for but a few species is severely restricted. Research in the last years shows that forest species have very different qualitative and spatial demands on their environment, which require complex and broad solutions. This poses a great problem for conservation and often forces societies/ decision-makers to make decisions based on assumptions rather than on empirical data. With assumptions follow uncertainty, a factor that is necessary to control. We identify and discuss the uncertainties of steps that are considered to be important for preserving biodiversity on a regional level and exemplify this with cases from southern Sweden. We argue that there is no universal solution for the conservation of biodiversity. In strongly fragmented and transformed regions like southern Sweden, a mix of species approaches and ecosystem approaches is necessary for biodiversity conservation. Programs for preserving biodiversity should be flexible, not rigid, allowing for modifications due to a constantly increasing body of knowledge and environmental changes. Prominent gaps in our knowledge include species dispersal ability and propensity, extinction rates and the species dependence on fragmentation and landscape history. It is possible that the question of responsibility species (a species for which a region has an explicit conservational responsibility) may gain in importance, an issue with far-reaching implications for economy and inter-regional compensatory systems. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The article criticizes this view which tends to ignore the complex crisis of the relationships between societies and ongoing economic competition among nation-states. Therefore, the difference between intentional political control and the unintended stabilization of social contradictions (regulation, in the usage of the French regulation school) is shown, and used to analyse the broader context of the regulation of societal relationships with nature. For an adequate understanding of such a network of international regulation, however, one must carefully analyse the transformation of the nation-state within the process of capitalist globalization and its role in this network which goes beyond environmental regimes. Global biodiversity politics is an interesting example of such a network: it can be seen that capital interests in the use of genetic resources for the 'life science industry' is a driving force in this area of contention. National regulations, in the sense of intentional politics, constitute a necessary aspect of the process of creating stable conditions for the commodification and valorization of genetic resources. At the same time, environmental politics becomes part of global capitalist competition and regional and national competition.},

We propose a process to recognize natural rare and/or threatened soils based on five categories that could be used to describe the values associated with these soils: (1) economic; (2) ecosystem; (3) scientific; (4) historic/cultural; and (5) rarity. We propose not a legally binding designation, but a program modeled on several successful wildlife-oriented conservation awareness and education programs. We aim to create a non-politically mired system that draws attention to rare and threatened soils and their role in supporting people and ecosystems while lending support to the soils' study and management. Land-use planners might find this system valuable in helping to identify ecologically important areas. Conservation organizations might find the scientifically based assessments of soil value useful in defining their designations of important conservation areas. The publicity generated by designating rare and threatened soils might help U.S. citizens and politicians appreciate the importance of soils in so many aspects of our lives. © Soil Science Society of America.},
